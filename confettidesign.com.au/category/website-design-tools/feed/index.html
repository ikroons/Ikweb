										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Confused about why your website might not be converting visitors? Do you have website shame or know exactly what you would like it to look like but no idea how to make that happen?</p>
<p>Our infographic of the anatomy of an effective website covers the 12 core elements every effective site requires. It is always our starting point when we start researching a new client&#8217;s existing site, conduct a website review or offer a quote for a new site or a website makeover.</p>
<p>Consider your own website using our snazzy infographic or if you are about to have a website designed / developed make sure you have taken into account all of these elements.</p>
<p>We use a structured approach to reviewing sites and encourage you to do the same so you don&#8217;t missing something important and in order to make that first impression count when you go live with your website.</p>
<p>The final 12th item which is not included is on-page optimisation. This is where you complete the keywords your customer is using to find you and your services in search engines like Google.</p>
<p>You may also like to have your website reviewed for you. We offer a full website review, a recorded video that addresses all these 12 elements as a first time visitor. You also receive a written report looking the anatomy of an effective web design as shown below.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>You get what you pay for.</h2>
<h4>You don’t know what you don’t know until you experience something different.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Late last year I was introduced to the amazing world of eyelash extensions. Instantly a convert I had my re-fills religiously every 3 weeks and experienced the benefits of no mascara, no morning-after smudge. Not to mention the compliments, which we love lets not lie!</p>
<p>In late April I visited Bali and considered having them filled as I heard they were half the price there.</p>
<p>I can see you already shaking your head and saying to yourself, “Don’t do it, what are you thinking?!” In my defense, I did get a recommendation for a salon. How do you qualify a recommendation is a very valid question.</p>
<p>However you would be correct, I had a semi-ok experience except for the freak-out mid session when my right eye was glued shut! I did think they looked thicker but that was all I thought at the time.</p>
<p>I returned to my lovely lady in Bayside, at Touch Body and Soul several weeks later and find out what a hatchet job I’ve received and discover we have to either start from scratch or go the slow process of waiting for the duds to drop out.</p>
<p>Hayley tells me how lucky I am that I escaped the eyelid infections (I do a search on Google images) but I also still don&#8217;t realise how good a job Touch do until I share my Bali horror with others.</p>
<h4>Lessons from life #12054888.</h4>
<p>Consider what you are saving when you get a deal. When asking how much should a website cost be sure you compare all the features of the service to see if there are hidden costs or value add benefits that will save you in the long run.</p>
<p>In thinking about this experience I realise that cost is always a factor in deciding which solution to go with. The costs can range from free to over $30k.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This article hopefully will help put all design &amp; development options on a level playing field so you can make the best choice for you.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Check what happens when you sign up for a free option. If they take your credit card when does it start to be billed? After you add 2 pages? After 6 months? Ask if you can’t find the information on their FAQ’s</li>
<li>What is the domain name? If it looks anything like this mybusiness.cheapwebsite.com.au stay away.
<ol>
<li>Because you are sending traffic to their domain, their ranking improves and you gain no good Google Juice.</li>
<li>Your business brand is being hijacked if it’s connected to another brand</li>
<li>It’s confusing to a customer as to what you are all about</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Is there an SEO component to help you building on your Google ranking and movement up the pages?
<ol>
<li>Can you control what goes into the SEO built-in portion of each page.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>What are the hidden charges?</li>
<li>If it starts as free and then you wish to upgrade to a paid version can you move the data? Some companies won’t let you move files, they lock the copy / images / pages.</li>
<li>Will they have advertisements on your site or footer? Unrelated blatant marketing of their brand? You want complete control over your brand on your site.</li>
<li>Companies can disappear at any time. A recent customers website was hacked, when we looked into it the supplier was actually hacked too and no record of them. She had to start from scratch. If her site was a sub-address to theirs (cheapwebsites.mysmallbusiness.com.au ) then that would be gone too.</li>
<li>Malware can appear on your site because their level of security is not good enough, and you can’t control that. You are at the mercy of their security. Really really important you look at that.</li>
<li>Size of bandwith offered on the free or cheap versions. This means the amount of data that can be transferred from where the files are stored (hosting) to the viewer.</li>
<li>What is the size of storage, meaning how much information or size of files on your site. This will impact images, pages and experience for visitor. When you reach your limit the company will ask you to pay for more space.</li>
<li>How flexible are the design options? Do you want to look like a cookie cutter website?</li>
<li>What are the options for growth? Adding on a shop or a membership section? Adding in pop-ups and embedded forms for email capture? How easy is it to link with an email manager like Mailchimp so you can email market to grow your business?</li>
<li>What is customer service like? Do they offer 24hour live chat or support tickets with a 12 hour response KPI? What after sales service is offered or guarantee on their work.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck and reach out if you have any questions about an option you are considering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know that colors play a large role in our marketing efforts, but have you ever taken a closer look at how color may be affecting your bottom line?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, color has a powerful influence on our emotions and decision making abilities, not to mention our first impressions of everything from a logo to a landing page.</p>
<p>Have you considered what are the best converting CTA button colours and headline text?</p>
<p>Here are some key color areas to think about when designing your landing pages:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Your brand<br />
</strong>It is vital that you consider your branding when selecting colours for CTA buttons and text. The page needs to be appealing and easy to read.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Colours<br />
</strong>Colours on the colour wheel can be grouped and analysed by emotion, divided into passive vs active colours.&nbsp;Active colors are the brighter colours, from vibrant green round to bright red. They tend to excite both the mind and body and can be sources of energy and creativity. These are generally used as CTA buttons.<br />
Passive colors are the more neutral and muted colors&nbsp;and tend to increase mental focus and have a calming effect. These include dark green round to deep plum and red. You will find text more often used in these colours.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Colour-Wheel.png" rel="attachment wp-att-3081"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3081" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Colour-Wheel.png" alt="Colour-Wheel-Confetti-Design" width="526" height="524"/></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Background colour<br />
</strong>When using a solid color on your landing page background, make sure it won’t interfere with the text. And if it’s a deep color, make sure the text contrasts well. Mostly use a rule of squinting and see if the main headline jumps out. Easiest choice is to keep to whitespace to draw your viewer’s eye to your CTA. <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/how-to-design-a-landing-page-that-converts/" target="_blank">Design a clean landing page int</a>ended to create a flow towards your CTA.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Call-to-action colors</strong><br />
In choosing your colors for calls to action, consider what each color represents to you, your brand and how consumers will perceive them.</p>
<p>Try using this tool to select colours–&nbsp;<a href="http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF" target="_blank">Paletton Tool</a></p>
<p>Or this one is also great for guiding you in finding colour palates &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/?base=2&amp;rule=Analogous&amp;selected=2&amp;name=My%20Color%20Theme&amp;mode=rgb&amp;rgbvalues=1,0.23426724137910926,0.050000000000000044,0.91,0.08711027298838832,0.04550000000000004,1,0,0.33497536945833417,0.91,0.04550000000000004,0.7673362068969265,0.8264218540076399,0.050000000000000044,1&amp;swatchOrder=0,1,2,3,4" target="_blank">Adobe Colour Tool</a></p>
<p>You may need Hex colour or RGB colours for these tools or for using Canva so this is great one:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.color-hex.com/color/cb0044" target="_blank">HEX to RGB &amp; CMYK Tool</a></p>
<p>As a rule use contrasting colours on the colour wheel to those in your brand so it stands out. You may be limited a bit by your branding colours therefore if your brand is without a contrast colour, as they are all of a similar colour hue, then plot one of those colours in the tool and see what comes as a contrast to pick for your CTA buttons. Always keep in mind your brand, your customer’s tastes and good sense!</p>
<p>This article is quite useful in the argument around colour choice and ‘red as a CTA button is always more effective&#8217;&nbsp;<a href="http://conversionxl.com/which-color-converts-the-best/" target="_blank">Which Color Converts The Best, by Conversion XL</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day the success will be measured with testing and trying it out on your market with your copy and product. Good luck. x</p>

			<p>The purpose of your About me page is to build an emotional connection and build trust and credibility. This is where the power lies in attracting customers. Your about me page is an opportunity to make a real connection with your customers. It is one of the most visited pages on your website because people want to know who is behind the brand, products and services they are about to invest in. They want to know that it is a safe investment and who they will be dealing with, whether you are the face of the business or not. Here are some questions to answer that will enable you to write a standout page.</p>
<p><span style="color: #cb0044;"><strong>Who am I helping?</strong></span> Review Part 1 of this 6-part series if you haven’t already determined who you serve. You can view here. Understanding who is your customer is vital in order to appeal to them with the appropriate language, slogans and imagery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #cb0044;"><strong>How can I help?</strong></span> In answering this question you are communicating to customers which of their problems you can solve. What benefit to their life you will make. We are not telling them how good we are at solving problems but defining the problem for them.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #cb0044;">Who am I, what is my story in relation to services that help others?</span></strong> Be revealing your personality and elements of your life you become human and vulnerable and it positions your unique selling proposition.</p>
<p><span style="color: #cb0044;"><strong>What do I do?</strong></span> Detail what you can do to solve their problems, what they recieve.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #cb0044;">What can others expect if they work with me?</span></strong> Explain the process you take to deliver the product or service. People don’t like surprises unless they are a nice surprise and outside of the delivery of what they pay for. Leave the surprises to the extras not the mandatories. You can read about managing customers expectations here.</p>
<p><span style="color: #cb0044;"><strong>How can I represent my personal and business brand visually?</strong></span> Select images that reinforce your personal style and business brand messaging.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #cb0044;">What tone is suitable for my About page?</span></strong> Is your brand fun and frivolous, serious or nurturing? Use language, tone and words that are in alignment with your service persona. Consistency represents reliability; it’s appealing and shows you are a professional.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Here are some links to about me pages that can offer you inspiration.</strong></span></p>

<p><a href="http://razvangarofeanu.com/#the-who" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://razvangarofeanu.com/#the-who</a> unique, simple, clear</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ghosthorses.co.uk/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.ghosthorses.co.uk/about/</a> quirky so get a feel for their style</p>
<p><a href="http://incaorganics.com.au/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://incaorganics.com.au/about/</a> its all about the product</p>
<p><a href="http://mailchimp.com/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://mailchimp.com/features/</a> services are clear</p>
<p><a href="http://www.canmoremakeupartist.com/about/">http://www.canmoremakeupartist.com</a>  the text isn&#8217;t the focus here for me, it&#8217;s the confidence, authority and trust instilled by her associations and recommendations. Listing theses in a visual list of icons of the organisations is all thats needed and the photo of her at work for you to feel confident of her abilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.katenorthrup.com/about-contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.katenorthrup.com/about-contact/</a> appeals to what you may want out of life and how she can help you gain that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qualtrics.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">h</a><a href="http://www.qualtrics.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ttp://www.qualtrics.com/about/</a> a techy business offering but they make it simple and not too techy to understand and I have faith they know what they do</p>
<p><a href="http://www.daniellelaporte.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.daniellelaporte.com/about/</a> undeniably unique and true to her brand</p>
<p><a href="http://elsaisaac.com/about-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://elsaisaac.com/about-me/</a> her page gives you a real sense of who she is and how she can help you.</p>
<p>As your About Me page is so important, if you find it too overwhelming I recommend using a professional copywriter. It can be very challenging to write about yourself and be succinct and blow your own trumpet at the same time as sound humble!</p>
<p><strong>Now you&#8217;ve mastered the word, don&#8217;t forget the images</strong></p>
<p>The other crucial element in your About Me page is the photography of you. Whether you are the face of your business or not you must, must, must firstly use a professional photographer to take your About Me page photos. I talk more about the importance of your personal branding in this article <a href="http://contentmagazine.com.au/2014/12/personal-style-part-brand-saying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly ensure you have a professional do your make-up and hair for the shoot. I recently had to gently push a client to invest in this part of her shoot and having seen the photos, she now appreciates the difference it made. She looked amazing and she loved the experience of seeing herself look so polished. Make-up needs to be a stronger than you would wear in real life so it can be a bit overwhelming, but the effect is fabulous. I have a list of professionals that I use and can recommend. They all do specials throughout the year or particular days of the week, so don&#8217;t be afraid to ask.</p>
<p><strong>Final Note</strong></p>
<p>On a final note remember most importantly that a good About Us page means nothing if you don’t have your own domain name and web host. If you are using a free blog like Tumblr or Blogger you are growing a brand that you don’t fully own or control. Do you wish to put your brand at risk?</p>
