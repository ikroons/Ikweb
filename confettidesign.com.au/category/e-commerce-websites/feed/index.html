<h2><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-14688 aligncenter" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot-1024x831.png" alt="" width="1024" height="831" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot-1024x831.png 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot-300x243.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot-768x623.png 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot.png 1345w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />When does the application close?</h2>
<p>The rebate applications will be available from the 1<sup>st</sup> December 2020 to 31<sup>st</sup> March 2021, or until the funds for the program are exhausted.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How quickly will I receive the rebate?</h2>
<p>As a small business, you will be contacted by the Victorian Government within six weeks to ensure you have started to use your selected digital product and payment. Once the Government has confirmation of the continued use of the digital product, you will receive the $1,200 rebate within 10 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To be eligible for the rebate, your business will need to be located in Victoria and held an ABN since 13<sup>th</sup> September 2019. You will also need to be registered for GST on the 13<sup>th</sup> September 2020.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-14689 aligncenter" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot-1024x831.png" alt="" width="1024" height="831" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot-1024x831.png 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot-300x243.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot-768x623.png 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot.png 1345w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />What if I already use one of the digital products?</h2>
<p>To be eligible for the program, you need to ensure the digital product is a new adaption and is not currently being used by the business. The great news is that the eligibility includes upgrading an existing product with additional features that provide greater digital capability. If you have used one of the products such as Shopify in the past, which is more than a year ago, and resume the adoption of the digital product you will also be eligible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What doesn’t the program cover?</h2>
<p>The program does not cover renewals of existing digital products provided as part of the program. It also does not include minor updates to existing products. Most importantly, the digital product, such as Shopify, must be available under the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How will I know how to use the digital products available under the <em>Small Business Digital Adaption Program </em>?</h2>
<p>Once you are registered under the program, free training and workshops are available and training dates are available in the training calendar that is published on the <a href="https://www.business.vic.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Victoria</a> website. The training and workshops are run across Melbourne metropolitan area and also in regional Victoria. The great news is if you are currently using one of the available products you can also attend the workshop and training days.</p>

			<h6>Learning management systems (LMS) are software platforms that enable businesses to build and deliver educational courses. Many consumers are looking to increase their skill set and knowledge by completing online training programs, rather than physically attending schools. An LMS delivers content, which can include knowledge documents, videos, courses and quizzes. The team at Confetti Design has delivered several projects using the learning management system <em>Access Ally</em>, and we thought it was worthwhile to review and detail this LMS.</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is <em>Access Alley</em>?</h2>
<p>Many LMS are not a stand-alone system and are plugins for websites such as WordPress. <em>Access Ally</em> is a complete plugin for WordPress that enables small business to build an  online learning business within their WordPress small business website. <em>Access Ally </em>focuses on deep CRM integration, and simplifies the process to add tests, progress the tracking of course completion, video links or anything else you would like to offer on your course pages. <em>Access Ally</em>  supports the upload of student work. The key selling point for <em>Access Ally</em> is its integration with your existing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How did <em>Access Ally</em> start?</h2>
<p><em>Access Ally </em>began as way to manage access to online courses and quickly developed into a full service membership plugin. <em>Access Ally </em>has WordPress-themed order forms that allows users to offer one-time payments, subscriptions. It is enhanced with individually triggered time-sensitive coupons, including trial offers, and 1-click upsells to your customers. <em>Access Ally </em>enables members to manage their credit cards that are on file and their subscriptions from within Access Ally.</p>
<h2><em>Access Ally</em> Pricing – A Simple Offer</h2>
<p><em>Access Ally </em> has a transparent pricing offer ,where subscribers pay one flat fee, regardless of the number of courses, memberships, or members a small business will have. Even better, <em>Access Ally </em>does not take commissions on any of your online course sales, and integrates with Stripe and PayPal straight out of the box.</p>
<h2>Why <em>Access Ally </em>over other Learning Management Systems</h2>
<p><em>Access Ally </em>prides its on being the one tool that simply handles everything<em> &#8211;</em> from accepting payments, the ability to create courses, easy integrations with online tools such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Active Campaign</li>
<li>Convert Kit</li>
<li>Drip</li>
<li>Infusionsoft</li>
<li>Keap</li>
<li>Ontraport, and of course CRM’s.</li>
</ol>
<p>It offers the best member management of any LMS on the market. There is effortless integration of <em>Access Ally’s</em> learning management system (LMS) with your existing CRM. Small business will not need to pay for and integrate additional plugins to handle payments and payment administration, membership levels to run cohesive membership sites, and integration with your CRM for marketing automation. Some of the course features include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant and dripped courses</li>
<li>Team accounts</li>
<li>Progress tracking of courses</li>
<li>Homework submissions</li>
<li>Video view tracking and bookmarks</li>
<li>Quizzes and Certificates</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Access Ally</em> Functionality – the Course Creation Wizard</strong></p>
<p>The team at Confetti Design found the ease of use and functionality of <em>Access Ally&#8217;s Course Creation Wizard</em> a great selling point for this LMS as it creates courses as a WordPress page. Small business can easily keep their content, or import it into another LMS product later. When evaluating LMS’s for our small business website customers, we found many business lose access to their content if they decide to cancel their LMS subscription, which is not the case with <em>Access Ally</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Access Ally </em>enables small business to select your LMS compatible “WordPress theme” for functionality, speed, design flexibility, and features. There is no requirement for someone who can code in CSS to make the design, such as buttons and breadcrumbs, look and feel modern. It’s all in <em>Access Ally</em>!</p>
<p><strong><em><br />

Gaining knowledge on how to make use of this platform to benefit your business through social media marketing will definitely be beneficial to your business.</p>
<p>There are three major areas in particular that you need to focus on to achieve your set goals: content planning, content creation and measurement.</p>
<h2>Content Plan</h2>
<p>Your content plan must refer back to your customer avatar completed in I<a href="/instagram-guide-start-right/">nstagram Guide – Start Right</a>.</p>
<p>You consider what is important to your customer and how can you engage them the most.</p>
<p>This may sound hard so we have broken into 2 steps.</p>
<p><strong>1. Your Instagram Topics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> is to create topics to share about while keeping your customer in mind. Here are some<br />
typical topics.</p>
<ol>
<li>Education – educate on your product, how your business is giving the best value</li>
<li>Behind the scenes – your brand may very sophisticated and high end. Behind the scenes will be luxe images of staff at events or with customers. Your brand may be relaxed and your customer enjoys humour, as such your behind the scene might be more about jokes or bloopers. Can include getting to know each of your sales team. May include a mascot like your dog or something more unique. The goal of behind the scene is to give your feed personality, allowing your customer to relate and connect with you.</li>
<li>Product &#8211; the easiest topic but still keep in mind what your customer wants to see. What is their aspirational product? Are fashion trends important to them? Or what celebrities use/wear?</li>
<li>Offers – This topic might not be appropriate weekly but at least monthly you would be advised to post with a specific call to action. (A call to action is a particular action you want your customer to do)</li>
<li>Customers – User generated content, ask your customers if they would post while in store or to share their wedding images with you. This could include proposal images or unboxing videos.</li>
<li>Aspiration / Inspiration – celebrating other people in your industry maybe overseas or celebrities using your product or wearing a style that you offer</li>
<li>Topical – what is happening from a calendar perspective, both internationally and locally. This will often link into offers.</li>
</ol>
<p>The purpose of firstly creating topics is that it focusses your content creation. You can create content once a week in advance and then schedule it for certain days. It ensures hours aren’t wasted worrying about what to post. You can spend a couple of hours a month in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Plan the week and month</p>
<p>We have 7 topics above but you could start with 3 or 4 and post 3 times a week to begin.</p>
<p>Set out your calendar as shown below.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to look at content creation keeping in mind the topics, customer and your<br />
goals.</p>

			<h2>Creating Content</h2>
<p>The creating of content should following the themes asset out above and be in line with your brand, customer and your marketing goals. Sticking to it will not only build your brand identity but will also make your followers look forward to the next post.</p>
<p>To help illustrate this process this guide will take the sample plan above and build out content with actual post examples. Brand consistency is one of the main tips in making an Instagram feed looking beautiful. Even with the most beautiful of products such jewelry can look messy if you aren’t careful to be mindful of your brand consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Monday &#8211; Topic 1. – Education</strong></p>
<p>Examples of post:<br />
DID YOU KNOW?</p>
<p>Sharing your expertise on a product line your company is offering. You can provide the history on why your product is popular, when and where is was first used, and the like. . The beauty of  these kinds of posts is that you can do a two image post and on slider that directly relates to the product you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday &#8211; Topic 2. – Aspiration</strong></p>
<p>Examples of post:<br />
Who is wearing what?</p>
<p>Posting about celebrities or known people who are using your product is a good aspiration post.  The key to this type of post is to ensure you consult your customer avatar to see who they  admire. If they are old-school elegance then Grace Kelly inspired posts might be appropriate. If your audience is young millennials then younger actors will be better. Don’t forget to tag the celebrity accounts and use hashtags.</p>
<p>What else is your customer looking for?<br />
This is where you can also link in with other brands / retailers in your local area. Sharing beautiful products or ideas that you customer will find useful is an ideal post for this topic. The added benefit is you tag the other businesses involved, it means your post exposure is increased.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday &#8211; Topic 3. – Behind the scene</strong></p>
<p>Have fun with this. Really show off who you are as a brand while keeping at the forefront who your customer is.</p>
<p>An example could be your morning tea for the staff or a birthday, or shooting your latest video/ image. It can be a video of your sales team re-merchandising after a great sales experience..  You can even speed up the video for a fun twist.</p>
<p><strong>Friday &#8211; Topic 4. – Product</strong></p>
<p>Product might seem an easy post topic. However here are a couple of pointers:</p>
<p>a. include your offers and use Linkt.ree to take them directly to the offer<br />
b. as always keep your customer front of mind<br />
c. as a brand manager we would ask you “what do you want to be known for?”<br />
then share those products more often.<br />
d. Keep the posts clean and elegant</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you can add more topics such as Saturday quotes. However it can be overwhelming to come up with the posts and keep up with the regularity so starting with 3 or 4 is a good ideas. Managing the content creation and the posting can be shared amongst your team too. However ensure you are careful with how your brand is portrayed on your page.</p>
<p>To illustrate how to pull these all together see a make-over of a feed below using the same topics as our example above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other general content tips</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. People Focused</strong><br />
Instagram is a platform where people share their experiences with other people. The photos posted in your Instagram account shouldn’t just be about selling your products—your content should always involve people, as this shows that your product is being enjoyed by real- life individuals.<br />
This can include customers, staff, suppliers, celebrities, local businesses</p>
<p><strong>2. Brand consistency / colour &amp; tone</strong><br />
The most successful Instagram pages are those that are consistently portraying the brand. By brand we mean values, colours of the logo and brand, consistency with their marketing collateral including website. The tone of the feed is also very similar. By this we mean they stick to a colour palate of 2 or 3 colours.</p>
<p>If your brand is navy and grey and the audience is average income earning living in seaside suburbs, you might share images that include lots of shades of blue and softer sandy colours. However you would not create content with reds and oranges. You might be less likely to create content with vibrant bright red and green.</p>
<p><strong>3. Narrative</strong><br />
With each post create a story or share a personal comment that you know will engage your follower and target audience. The most engaged posts are statistically those that have a few sentences relating to the topic, weaving in your brand story, customer or brand personality. Remember to always use hashtags too.</p>
<p><strong>4. Followers, Locations, and Brands Tagging</strong><br />
One of the best practices of successful brands using Instagram is also to regram the posts of their followers and tag these followers in the process. This encourages your followers to post more about your product, and they also market your products with their own followers by doing so.<br />
If you have a brick-and-mortar store or if you are regularly having events, using location- specific posts will allow you to discover new fans and prospective followers.</p>
<p>Apart from followers and locations, you should also tag other brands and accounts and hopefully give you a shout-out, too. These relevant tags are indirect ways of encouraging promotion.</p>
<p><strong>5. Cross promote using other Social Media Platforms</strong><br />
Aside from using your content in your Instagram platform, it will also be beneficial to use these contents to your other social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. It doesn’t just give you more ROI out of your Instagram presence, but you are also maximizing the reach of your content.</p>
<p><strong>6. Products and Promotions</strong><br />
With wedding season or new product launch plan the posts that lead up to it to build interest. Mark events with promotions to help achieve your goals and drive visitors to your online store to redeem discount coupons. Always include a sign up with the calls to action on your site so you can capitalize on using their email address to email market at a later stage.</p>
<p><strong>7. Giveaways and Contests</strong><br />
Studies show that brands that run contests grow their followers count faster than those who don’t. We know that giveaway- related posts receive huge amount of engagements, and this is one effective way to increase your followers and fans and achieve those goals.</p>
<p><strong>8. Paid Ads</strong><br />
Let’s not disregard the potential of running paid ads on Instagram. There have been many success stories of brands that use Instagram ads by using Instagram Stories and videos to grab the attention of users. You should start doing research first about Instagram ads and familiarize yourself with the process before using this paid ad, though. Remember to know your goals and the metrics that you’ll be looking at to ensure that you’ll be able to steer your marketing strategy to the right direction. Paid ads targeting a local demographic and for product specials are a good place to start.</p>
<p><strong>9. Consider working with influencers</strong><br />
Influencer marketing involves a paid association with another Instagram account with a substantial and engaged follower count. The influencers’ followers allow you to tap into a new group of users that you’re trying to engage. It functions like an ad because the relationship is paid for. However, if you find the right influencer for your business, it can certainly be a fruitful way to increase your sales as well as grow your number of followers.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Measurement</h3>
<p>If we backtrack a bit to <a href="/instagram-guide-start-right/">Instagram Guide- Start Right</a> where you set your SMART goal, we needed to be able to measure activity to show how successful the return on investment has been both in expenditure or time and energy.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram can offer you insights within the app.</strong><br />
One of the most valuable tools you get is the free analytics tools. In Instagram Insights, you will be able to see key information about your follower’s demographics and the time they are most active on the platform. Similarly, you can view your top performing posts and stories, which will give you a better idea of the type of content that your followers find most interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Bitly</strong><br />
Using link services like <a href="https://www.bitly.com">https://www.bitly.com</a> can help you track particular campaigns or links to offers or product promotions.</p>
<p><strong>Foot traffic</strong><br />
As you are brick and mortar businesses your goal is ideally to get more foot traffic, as such having a coupon that has to be redeemed in store is a great measure of the success of any promo.</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong><br />
Your website must have analytics tracking codes as this will also show the statistics of people coming from your Instagram account into your site and to which pages. If they land on a page that is an offer but they bounce (meaning they click off immediately) it is vital you consider what  message your website is giving. You don’t want to re-vamp your Instagram account only to send potential customers to your website which is not communicating the same brand message or level of sophistication your customer is expecting.</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have your pick of social media platforms, but for retailers the most successful and popular at the moment is Instagram. In the US 71% of businesses are on Instagram, there is no denying it is the place to be, and the visual nature of Instagram makes it likely to be the leader for a while to come.<br />
If you are not on Instagram then read up on our easy to follow steps so you start the right way. If you are already a gun on ‘the gram’ then these tips will be a good checklist to make sure you stay at the top of your game!<br />
This guide will take you through the 4 steps to starting in Instagram the right way that will make both the returns for your efforts and the on-going management so much easier.<br />
</span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 – Understanding your customer</strong></h3>
<p>Before you even think of creating the account, you want to get crystal clear on who your jewelry customer is. Truly understanding your target market is one of the most crucial things in running a successful business. It is only by having a clear idea in your mind of who you would like to reach, sell to or help that you can tailor and target your messages to have the strongest impact on your audience.</p>
<p>This has to be the key step that underpins your future success on Instagram. And really any marketing activity. Without it all your posting is like a scatter gun approach and the likelihood of connecting with your audience is slim.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you need to know your customer so clearly?</strong></p>
<p>1. You can create content to engage and connect with them when you have them in the forefront of your mind.<br />
2. You can ask yourself ‘will our perfect customer relate to this, be inspired to act, feel an emotional connection, be moved, feel like we ‘get them?’<br />
3. If you wish to use influencers, knowing who your customer is ensures you pick the right influencer.<br />
4. Engaging in cross promotions is easier as you look for other businesses who share the same customer.<br />
5. Although not a direct impact on your Instagram activity, knowing WHERE your customer hangs out or what they do in their life can guide your traditional marketing efforts. Local cafes to be linked with, event venues, magazines to advertise in. When you know where your customer spends their life means you can position yourself literally in their sight!</p>
<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>
<p>• What are your customer’s values? What is important to them?<br />
• What is their lifestyle? Or how do they spend their time? What is important to them?<br />
• What is their age?<br />
• Where do they live?<br />
• Is there a specific gender you serve more than another? – Who is really doing the research on your product?<br />
• What brands do they love?<br />
• Where do they eat, holiday, shop regularly?<br />
• What are their aspirations?<br />
• What magazines do they read, films watch, Netflix shows?</p>
<p><strong>The Problems</strong></p>
<p>• List all the problems you solve for your customers?<br />
• What emotions do they feel at the exact moment they discover your store and service?<br />
• What specific words and phrases are they saying to themselves or using to friends when describing how it feels to discover your service?</p>
<p><strong>The Solutions</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter whether you could realistically deliver or create these experiences, the goal is simply to unlock your imagination and challenge yourself to step into your customer’s shoes and see things in a new way. These insights will help with the type of content you create and how you try to engage your customers via Instagram.<br />
Before they found you what was their reality as it relates to buying a product like yours?<br />
• How were they trying to solve the problem?<br />
• Where were they looking to find a solution?<br />
• Who were they talking to in order to find a solution?<br />
• How was it impacting their personal life?<br />
• Have they tried other solutions before?<br />
• Why did that solution not work for them? Why are they still looking?<br />
• What do they wish Jewelers understood about them?<br />
• What is your customer’s dream? In their ideal world, what’s their ultimate fantasy of how your product or service would be delivered?<br />
• Do they have barriers to purchase from you?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions help build out a real picture of your target audience/s. Now you have this ‘persona’ or ‘ideal customer’ described it’s useful to even go to the extent of naming them, find images from magazines to visualize the perfect customers. It may be that you base this avatar on one of your best customers. In fact you could go to your most loyal customer and ask them to help answer the questions.</p>
<p>You not only have an amazing understanding of who you need to connect with via your posts, you also have a huge amount of content right in those answers. To see how we use all this fantastic insights be sure to download the guide called Instagram – Creating Content That Engages.<br />
Now we move onto the goal setting step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Set Your Goals</strong></h3>
<p>Now you have a good idea of who you want to become your brand follower, come into your store or click through to your website, you want to get your goals clear. The reason we do this is that having a clear goal or 2 or 3 goals allows you to purposefully create content and more chance of achieving the set goals.</p>
<p>Haphazardly posting is not a viable strategy when it comes to Instagram for business. Once you define who is your customer you need to define what it is your brand wants to do, then you can begin to better speak the language of your followers.</p>
<p><strong>How to Create a Social Media Goal</strong></p>
<p>Use the oldie-but-goodie SMART technique to set your goals.</p>
<p>S- <strong>Specific </strong></p>
<p>Goals should be clear and simple, but very detailed in terms of what you want to happen.</p>
<p>NOT SPECIFIC &#8211; increase our followers<br />
SPECIFIC &#8211; increase our followers by 100% by end of month August 2019</p>
<p>M- <strong>Measurable </strong></p>
<p>You will need to have a goal that you can measure, and there are a lot of social media tools that can help you measure the success of your strategy such as Instagram Insights. Ensure your website has analytics so you can track the number of new users that come from your Instagram account to specific product pages.</p>
<p>You can use a tool like Bitly.com that is a unique trackable url you can put into your bio.<br />
If you would like more reading on this..here is an article that lists 8 Instagram Analytics Tools <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/instagram-analytics-tools/">https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/instagram-analytics-tools/</a></p>
<p>A- <strong>Action Oriented </strong></p>
<p>This part is where you’ll create actionable task that will turn your goal into reality. Your “plan of attack will be detailed here as you create your goal.</p>
<p>An example of a goal is to increase the traffic to your store or online store that results in 20 new sales directly via your Instagram account in the month of August. This goal could include the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post offers that are redeemed in store or online</li>
<li>Post blogs</li>
<li>Post new products</li>
<li>Linked In-store activities – launch of a new product or a joint wedding dress fashion show with local bridal boutique in your store</li>
<li>Post snippet of a video with full length video on the website</li>
</ul>
<p>R- <strong>Realistic </strong></p>
<p>With all your resources on hand (time, money, people), is the goal you’re setting realistic? This is what you need to keep in mind when creating your goal. This is where you may reduce your goal or look to outsource some tasks to achieve the goals.</p>
<p>T- <strong>Time Bound </strong></p>
<p>Every goal needs a deadline, otherwise it’s not a goal—it’s a wishful thinking. Keeping in mind the complexity of the actions, as well as your resources, create a time frame that is both suitable to the goal as well as realistic.</p>

<p>✓ Ads Budget : 8 week period x 2.5 posts a week x $10 = $200</p>
<p>✓ Content writer and graphic designer hired to create materials</p>
<p><strong>Time Bound- </strong>2 month period with check point of 1 month</p>
<p><strong>Set Your Baseline </strong></p>
<p>It is important that before you take any actions in your social media account against this goal that you have set your starting point. This means that you have the data from an analytics point of view on where you’re currently at (traffic to your site, bounce rates, particular page visits.) so that you’ll know exactly how your statistics are improving after implementing your actions.</p>
<p><strong>Check Points </strong></p>
<p>Lastly, set up check points to review your statistics so that you’ll see which is working or not. Is the ad budget boosting enough or reaching your preferred audience? Or is brand awareness really what you should focus on? You can check the social media and google analytics that you’ve set to gauge and evaluate your efforts.</p>
<p>Now you have a goal or set of goals you need a clear strategy to achieve these. However before we embark on that we need to do the one thing that makes all of our efforts easier, understanding our customer.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Now you have a clear vision of the customer to attract and a goal or set of goals your next step is to create a social media strategy. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Let’s recap </strong>– Goal #1 &#8211; Increase Brand Awareness in next 2 months</p>
<p>It is tricky to translate your social media efforts into sales especially when you’re in a brick and mortar business. However not including a social media strategy is effectively ignoring a huge portion of the potential customers.</p>
<p>Common metrics that can be measured are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of followers</li>
<li>Number of clicks through to the website from Instagram</li>
<li>Number of sales using unique Instagram promo code</li>
<li>Number of tags on other pages</li>
<li>Number of check ins</li>
<li>Number of comments</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instagram strategies to achieve this goal could be: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build content themes to speak to a problem of target audience</li>
<li>Share products your customer loves more than any others</li>
<li>Create articles that are indirectly related to your product but your customer would find helpful. Link these articles to your website, include the products on the blogs as an indirect selling opportunity</li>
<li>Share reviews that overcome barriers your customers have</li>
<li>Run a competition for free tickets to an event your customer would love to go to in your local area. One of the great benefits of having a location centric business is your customer is near you</li>
<li>Include your customers in video or in user generated content</li>
<li>Offer rewards for customers who share an unboxing image or video tagging you</li>
<li>Implement Instagram shopping on your website and linked to your account</li>
<li>Engage an influencer who shares your customer</li>
<li>Share other Instagram pages and content that your customer audience also follows to broaden your reach</li>
<li>Always reply or like any comments</li>
<li>Uncover niche hashtags that your customer is also following. Similarly, location-specific hashtags are perfect for zeroing in on an audience in your own neighborhood.</li>
<li>Consider the time of day to share when you know your audience is on the platform. Set up a schedule for posting so you are also not on it 24/7!</li>
<li>Tell stories to captivate your audience, the narrative of your brand is just as important as your customer in your content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list can go on.. but you have a comprehensive guide now of how to get started right, even before you set your account. The next guide will cover setting up your account and then the final in the series is about creating the content with purpose to achieve your goals.</p>

			<p>McKinsey is a global management consulting firm and provides lots of research about business practice.<br />
They recently wrote an article called “Building an e-commerce business: The lessons on moving fast”.</p>
<p>With consumers moving online in reaction to coronavirus restrictions, companies will need to learn how to launch new e-commerce businesses and quickly. Although the article focuses on large corporates, the team at Confetti Design think there are plenty of lessons that small businesses can learn from the McKinsey article.</p>
<p>As the full implications of COVID-19 are still unknown, there is emerging evidence that  points to a significant shift from retail “bricks-and-mortar” to e-commerce and online selling, as customers find shops closed and are limited in their ability to leave the house. This is backed by data that shows e-commerce jumped from 15 to 20% in China and a whopping 81% in Italy. These dramatic growth stats are just for February to March this year!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How long does it take to create an ecommerce capability? We disagree with McKinsey!</strong></h2>
<p>We agree with McKinsey that businesses can create a working e-commerce site in much less time than they think. In their estimation an e-commerce site can be running in less than 4 months. Our experience with building small business e-commerce sites however is it can be far speedier, with many sites being developed in less than a month. In fact, we have examples of our small business e-commerce websites being up and running in less than two weeks – if product, pricing, content and images are ready to go.</p>
<p>We recently worked with <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/website-portfolio/purely-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Purely Christmas</a>, who are passionate about applying an aesthetic sensibility to Christmas decorations. The Founder of the business had spent 15 years in retail and had a great understanding of what she wanted to offer. Confetti Design was able to launch the website within four weeks, working closely with the Founder who was hands-on with product description and uploading products to meet a tight deadline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before work starts on launching an e-commerce presence, small business owners need to be practical and logical. In some cases, rather than attempting to launch a full-blown digital business across all markets at once, a strategy would be to go to market fast with a narrow offering and in limited localities. This will help to gain strong traction and then scale up and out aggressively. This ‘tight offering’ strategy is supported by current supply chain challenges. There is nothing worse than being enticed by a product or service only to find the items is ‘out of stock’ online. I have personally experienced this multiple times in past weeks.</p>
<p>Our customer, <a href="https://boatshed7.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boastshed 7</a> source premium beach gear, accessories and skincare that is carefully curated from around the globe. Boatshed 7 started their e-commerce website with a smaller product offering, rather than the large range of beach products they had on offer. This enabled their marketing team to learn as they sold beach products and to offer a more tailored product that was targeted to a specific type of customer. As small businesses learn more about their customer, they can add more products to the product offering thus adding value to existing customers and broadening your reach to new customers. This is what Boatshed 7 did!</p>

			<h3><strong>Marketing ecommerce websites</strong></h3>
<p>Marketing is the key element of e-commerce websites. An understanding of the customer decision journey from complete lack of awareness to the moment a customer landed on the home page for the first time is of the utmost importance. We would suggest you begin your marketing effort well before launch, up to nine weeks before the launch, but considering the climate we are in you want to think creatively about this part of the prep work.</p>
<p>Just a few ideas are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Consider who has the same customer as you and would they share your offering to their database?</li>
<li>Create content to share on multiple platforms that solve your ideal customers problems as it relates to your products, linking back to your website
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>How to docs</li>
<li>Lists of resources</li>
<li>Opinion pieces</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Lists of articles</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a sign-up offer to bring people onto your email list with the intention to not sell immediately but nurture them to eventually become purchasers</li>
<li>During COVID-19 consider your customer and what is important to them. As you prepare your offer or terms perhaps you offer a portion of proceeds to assist someone or something that is in alignment with your customer values</li>
<li>Drive as much traffic as you can to your site either engaging in organic SEO either yourself or from an agency driven strategy, ADwords campaigns, re-marketing or Google shopping to build your authority and also potential email lists as well as customers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><br />
Measure!!!</strong></h3>
<p>We absolutely agree with McKinsey on this one.<br />
One of the great benefits with e-commerce websites is the ability to measure traffic and conversion in real-time with tools like Google Analytics. You can set up goals for tracking giving you real insights into how effective your website is performing. It allows you to track the progress that matters so that you can learn, adapt, and drive continual improvement. It is not enough to measure overall conversion or conversion by channel. Instead, small businesses need more granular metrics, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>identify relevant customer groups</li>
<li>measure micro-conversions per group</li>
<li>then improve continually – make changes to the shopping experience to increase website conversion</li>
<li>what is the current path to a goal ?</li>
<li>how many steps it takes to get to a goal?</li>
<li>where are you losing visitors?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of our customers, <a href="/website-portfolio/my-lollies/">MyLollies</a>, offers a large range of sweets and confectionary. The team at MyLollies are active Google Analytics users, who regularly monitor and make changes to their product placement and offers in order to successfully increase conversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main message here is that the launch of an e-commerce website is not a separate project, but much more an ongoing program of continual improvement which will bring success.</p>
<h3><strong><br />
Product and service offering tweaking</strong></h3>
<p>Not all ideas will work and sell well online. McKinsey gave an example of staff-curated bundles of products that were based on common occasions, such as birthdays. This tested really well with customers in pre-launch, but simply didn’t perform well in reality. Small businesses need to be prepared to cut product bundles or special offers if they are not working.</p>
<p>By keeping to a weekly review schedule, you can pivot away from poor ideas and generate new ones constantly until you find ones that work. Every week the improvements and lessons accumulate, and by month three, the e-commerce business has matured into a state at which a good sales day isn’t a victory but business as usual.</p>
<p>Building an e-commerce presence from scratch is no small undertaking for business. It was great to read and confirm our experience that a clear plan that is properly structured, can not only deliver an e-commerce website, but do it far faster than you might think is possible.</p>

			<p>Small businesses are looking for ways to implement new business models ahead of complete lockdown. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has tipped every Australian small business into unknown territory where continuing to exist has become a daily challenge.</p>
<p>The decisions taken by our State and Federal Governments to flatten the curve as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads around the world have been particularly rough on small business owners who have been told to shut their doors. This includes hospitality businesses, entertainment and major sports events, sports, play centres, swimming pools, gyms and fitness classes. It also extends to beauty therapy, tanning, massage and tattoo parlour operators.</p>
<p>The lifeline to many small businesses will be working out how to pivot to generate income. For those that don’t have an online shop, transition to an online offering quickly will help you keep your revenue going. Read <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/helpful-ecommerce-related-articles-from-confetti-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> how to go about this.</p>
<p>Here are some great examples of what businesses have done to continue to trade:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Food service industry</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-13489 aligncenter" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog.jpg" alt="Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog" width="1099" height="630" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog.jpg 1099w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-300x172.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-768x440.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1099px) 100vw, 1099px" /></p>
<p>Many restaurants and café’s that have had to close down the dine-in option but added their menu to Uber Eats to keep trading.  Uber Eats does take 30% of your revenue so having the ordering functionality through your website will earn you more. They have however agreed, due to public pressure, for restaurants to receive daily payments rather than once a week during the pandemic, and will scrap service fees on pick-up orders until 30 June.</p>
<p>Some business who have done this are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Attica </strong>&#8211; Beautiful meals delivered and wine selected by the head Somillier<br />
<a href="https://www.attica.com.au/delivery">https://www.attica.com.au/delivery</a></li>
<li>Wineries and cellar doors are begin to offer live wine tastings. <strong>WA Printhie Wines,</strong> Wine maker, Ed Swift view is &#8220;You can&#8217;t expect to keep operating in the same manner at a time like this, so we want to transfer our face-to-face cellar door experience to a safe online experience.”</li>
<li><strong>Relish Mama</strong> – Known in Bayside for the amazing cooking classes Nellie Kerrison has been running for years has added Ready-made meals to her offering as in person classes are now cancelled. Fresh or frozen and pick up or delivery. She is also looking at adding virtual cooking classes. <a href="https://relishmama.com.au/homemade-ready-made-meals/">https://relishmama.com.au/homemade-ready-made-meals/</a></li>
<li><strong>Scicluna’s</strong> is a fresh fruit and vegetable market and is now offering Grab &amp; Go boxes, either pick up or delivery from multiple locations. 3 ready packed boxes available. <a href="https://sciclunas.com.au/sciclunas-grab-go">https://sciclunas.com.au/sciclunas-grab-go</a></li>

<p>Most retail stores have an online presence already, the challenge now is to get found. If they don’t, now is the perfect time to add that revenue stream.<br />
Many local government councils are offering grants to finance this upgrade to your website.<br />
Check out the links below.</p>
<p>If your website doesn’t rank in Google you really need to consider Google Shopping or Google Ads to ensure your products get found. Consider adding these costs into any funding requests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Creative industries</strong></h2>
<p>The creatives industry includes artists, writers, hairdressers and beauticians.</p>
<p>Facebook is currently filled with businesses pivoting however it’s hard to find these services.</p>
<p>Some interesting ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>School holiday activities &#8211; virtual online art or writing classes</li>
<li>Artists can also apply to have an e-commerce facility added to their website – see here for details</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Fitness and Sports clubs</strong></h2>

<p>My own personal trainer has moved to zoom sessions in my home. It was just as hard and they even offered to drop off other weights or tools to offer variety.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have put together five main reasons why your e-commerce website needs a blog.</p>
<p>A lot of things should be considered when maintaining a high performing e-commerce website. One important element you must consider is creating and maintaining a blog. A place to share articles, tips, resources or how to videos. Basically any kind of content to add value to your customers.  Fresh regular content helps your website remain relevant,  allowing you to build your brand voice and increase awareness of you and your products.</p>
<h2><strong><br />
1. Search Engine Optimisation</strong></h2>
<p>A well written blog ensures that there is educative content that can be indexed by search engines. It ultimately helps your online store be more searchable by related topics, hence generating more visitors to your site.</p>
<p>Blogs help enhance the quality of SEO since it points appropriate answers of customer inquiries to your website. Blog posts that use quality SEO tactics such as targeting relevant keywords, placing them strategically on titles, and writing appropriate meta data descriptions give your e-commerce site the opportunity to rank in search engines—and this is always good for business! If this term is sounding foreign, read <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/seo-services-melbourne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our SEO services </a> to help understand it more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>2. Increase Traffic on your Website</strong></h2>
<p>As a business owner, your goal is to pique the interest of your target market, so that they will visit your site and increase your chances of making a sale. Posting your blog links in social media increases your chances to accomplish that goal.</p>
<p>Create a blog which is catchy, informative, and up to date. Posting these blog links in your store’s social media accounts will serve as an ad for your website. Depending on how useful your blogs are to the readers, the blog link will generate clicks and drive visitors /  traffic to your website, which is a big step towards increasing your sales!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. Brand Identity</strong></h2>
<p>There are numerous steps into starting up your brand identity. You’ll have to think about your niche, your market, a catchy <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/how-to-name-small-business/">brand name</a>, and most especially—building your brand identity.</p>
<p>When you think about a product, a specific brand usually comes to mind. For example, when thinking about carbonated drinks or soft drinks, you’ll probably think about Coca Cola. Or when thinking about toothpaste, you’ll immediately think about Colgate. These brands established their identity throughout the years by executing effective marketing strategies, which helped them gain the trust and loyalty of their customers. Same can be done with e-commerce websites. A blog is another tool to use in establishing your identity in a world full of rival brands and similar products.</p>
<p>Blogging provides a voice to your business.  You can use it to build your business’s unique personality which separates you from your competitors. Things to consider are what do you want to be known for that are also important to your customer? How can you give personality and life to your brand through your writing?  Your initial blogs could include answers to the basic identity questions: 1- who are you, and 2- what value your product or service gives to your customers. These will be ingrained in your readers’ minds as you write more and more articles on your website. In time, your readers may become your customers and eventually, your brand ambassadors!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>4. Build an Online Community</strong></h2>
<p>If you keep posting helpful and relative blogs consistently, your community of readers which are originally your searchers will keep going back to your site for new information. The comments that your viewers leave in your blog will spark a meaningful conversation with like minded people about the topics.</p>
<p>Blogs that are personalized and relatable are the ones readers usually react to. Make your blogging as inclusive and interactive as possible, specially when you are trying to build a community of brand supporters. Write about how your product contributes or solves a problem in their life. Encourage comments and conversations within your blog as these will also help in making your blog rank higher in related topics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5. Enhance Your Writing Skills</strong></h2>
<p>As important as having including a blog in your e-commerce website is, making sure your content is relevant and easy to read it also vital. Writing them doesn’t just keep you well connected to your business and your brand, but also helps develop your communication skills.</p>
<p>Here are some factors to consider when you are starting to write a blog for your online store:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your relevance. </strong>If not talking about products or services you offer, your blog should always have a connection to what your online store is offering.</li>
<li><strong>Your audience. </strong>Some blog writers are so used to using technical terms that they forget to consider who the target audience is. Basic rule is to make sure your writing style is conversational and simple. A common standard is aim for it to be understood by a high schooler! Writing like the way you talk is often a great start. Ultimately the goal is to engage your target audience so they stay on your site for longer.</li>
<li><strong>Your structure. </strong>Keep a structure which allows your audience to fully digest your blog content. The basic structure of a blog is 1-having an introduction of the topic, 2- giving more details about the topic and sub topics, and finally, summarising the main message of your blog. Structure using a hierarchy of information is also important for ranking. Google is more likely to rank your articles if they are structures logically.</li>
<li><strong>Your consistency</strong>. Decide on whether you will write a blog on a weekly or a monthly basis. This will not only help you rank higher in search engines—it will also keep your customers informed of the current trends and news about your business. This will gain more engagement to your current and future customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The e-commerce world is growing rapidly, hence the continued importance of having a blog for your website. You may start with simple blogs and then later evolve to longer ones and don&#8217;t forget you can also include video, images or infographics. What is important though is you start now and reap its benefits not only for your online store but also to your ranking. With all these gains (and nothing to lose), why don’t you start blogging now?</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many individuals have started their businesses by opening their own e-commerce website instead of a brick and mortar one. This is because aside from the fact that it has lower overhead costs, the online sales of goods have drastically grown over the years. If you’re one of those people who already have started or planning to start an online e-commerce store, you can be assured that you’re on the right track. But how exactly do we proceed?</p>
<p>Managing an e-commerce online business is as exciting as it can be stressful. We have gathered three of the most essential elements of an e-commerce website to ensure your success.</p>
<h2>Enticing Web Appearance</h2>
<p>The saying ‘first impressions last’ will always be true no matter what the case is—same for your online store. Your e-commerce website will be the first experience your customers will have of your business; and making it aesthetically appealing will increase your chances of turning your website visitors to loyal customers. However, gone are the days when we hear ‘the more, the merrier.’ In fact, we believe that having a clean, elegant design can help make your visitors stay longer browsing your online store.<br />
Aside from the overall web design, here are three items you need to consider which can help your online website more appealing and interactive:</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">1. Concise and complete product descriptions</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">People will always want to know exactly what they’re buying. Having a concise, complete, and well written product descriptions will establish the trust with your clients, making them customers for life!</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">2. High Quality and Proper Images for your Products</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Since your ecommerce website will be the first experience of your customers towards your product, make sure that you’ve placed the best images along with your exemplary product descriptions!</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">3. Call to Action Buttons</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As these buttons affect how your customers decide whether they will buy your product or not, it is important to pay attention on how you want it to look like on your e-commerce website. Consider your target market to decide on the text, color, and size of this button. Remember: this button transforms your website visitors into lifetime customers—make sure you design it well!</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">4. Product linking</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">How can you make it easy to buy MORE from you? Think strategically how your products work together, how can you sell more than one thing to a single customer? If they buy product A will they likely benefit from product B? Think about product bundling or recommend other items if they buy A that will help them, use the ecommerce smarts to place options near each other on the website pages.</p>
<h2>Effortless Customer Experience</h2>
<p>We cannot overemphasize the importance of making your customers at ease to your e-commerce website. Yours should be easy to navigate and visitor friendly. Here are some of the factors to consider, keeping customer experience in mind.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">1. Impressive Mobile Responsiveness</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As many people already use their mobile phones whenever they’re idle, they are also the ones who are likely to encounter your website one way or another. Your visitors should have a seamless experience of your website through their mobile phones, so make sure your website’s mobile responsiveness is excellent.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">2. Strategic Placement of Menus and Categories on your E-commerce Website</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As part of effortlessly navigating your website, situate your main menus or links to product categories in a strategic place that can easily get the attention of your customers, without interfering with your overall web design. You should also pay careful attention to your product categories, ensuring that each product is correctly tagged, showing up in logical categories to help the shopper buy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Also, ensure that your customers can easily return to the home page or main menu while browsing. Always make your contact information and shopping cart available for viewing, and they are linked to their respective pages.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">3. Easy Online Store Checkout Process</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Your customers have already decided to buy your product, so the checkout process should be as simple (but functional) as possible. Give an option to purchase as guest visitor, as many customers discontinue buying the product just because of the long and tedious process of signing up. Offer multiple payment and delivery methods. And lastly, pricing should be as transparent as possible, including discounts, extra fees, and even the shipping fees.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">4. Responsive Customer Support</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">You must assure your customers that when they need more information or if they encounter a problem buying your products, someone will be there to assist them with their needs. There are multiple ways that you can do this—set up a chat app in your website, send an email option, or encourage the customers to call your hotline. What’s important is to set the turnaround time for response for these channels. When you are responsive to your customers’ needs, there is a higher possibility that they’ll be your customers for life.</p>
<h2>Exceptional Content that Drives Traffic To your E-commerce Website</h2>
<p>A very important consideration to ensure the success of your ecommerce business is to have relevant, interesting, and “sharable” content which will push traffic to your website. You can start with simple but informative materials about the product or service you are promoting, and the following are several methods to accomplish this.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">1. Influence SEO</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We all know that Search Engine Optimisation or SEO is a marketing strategy that allows your website to rank on search engines, hence increasing the traffic to your site. But how do you start doing this? These are simple yet effective ways to impact SEO.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">• Start a blog. Writing relative content that use keywords connected to your ecommerce shop increases your probability to rank higher in search engines. Read more about why a blog is so important <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/why-your-e-commerce-website-needs-a-blog/">here</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">• Add relevant keywords. Using keywords in your blogs or other contents that are connected to your products or services will also have a positive impact on your site ranking.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">• Build internal links. Create links within your website so that Google will index your whole site.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">2. Video Content</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Video consumption has skyrocketed and is a continuing trend not looking to slow down. Creating video content that stimulates and intrigues your site visitors will likely increase the traffic in your site as well as your store’s sales. Think of a video content that is relevant to your site, such as introduction on what you offer, or a video of unboxing your product. Make sure that videos are well made and sound is clear!<br />
Think about your products and how will your customer interact with them? Is it hair accessories? Share video content on how to use the accessories showing your added value to help your customer.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">3. Infographics</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Presenting your information through words is good, but why limit yourself to words when you can use infographics or mixed media graphics for something a bit different? They can be as informative as they are visually pleasing, so your site visitors will look forward to your next post.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">4. Social Media Content</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Your social media posts are as important as all the other content you post in your website. There is boundless audience in the social media platforms and getting them to link to your site or buy your products via social will increase brand awareness. Make your content relative to your products and services and your target audience. Successful social content is often humorous, mostly honest and relatable to your audience. The goal though is always to get the viewer to your website. One day the social platform may close down but you always have 100% control over your e-commerce website.</p>
<p>The combination of having a visually stimulating website, exceptional customer service, and great product is the perfect balance to an e-commerce website. These elements need constant care and attention as your business and client base grows, and it can be challenging. Remember the satisfaction you’ll have seeing the success of your online shop is worth all the challenges you’ll encounter!</p>
