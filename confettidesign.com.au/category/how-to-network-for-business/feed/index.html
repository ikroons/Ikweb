			<p>Small businesses are looking for ways to implement new business models ahead of complete lockdown. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has tipped every Australian small business into unknown territory where continuing to exist has become a daily challenge.</p>
<p>The decisions taken by our State and Federal Governments to flatten the curve as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads around the world have been particularly rough on small business owners who have been told to shut their doors. This includes hospitality businesses, entertainment and major sports events, sports, play centres, swimming pools, gyms and fitness classes. It also extends to beauty therapy, tanning, massage and tattoo parlour operators.</p>
<p>The lifeline to many small businesses will be working out how to pivot to generate income. For those that don’t have an online shop, transition to an online offering quickly will help you keep your revenue going. Read <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/helpful-ecommerce-related-articles-from-confetti-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> how to go about this.</p>
<p>Here are some great examples of what businesses have done to continue to trade:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Food service industry</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-13489 aligncenter" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog.jpg" alt="Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog" width="1099" height="630" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog.jpg 1099w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-300x172.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-768x440.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1099px) 100vw, 1099px" /></p>
<p>Many restaurants and café’s that have had to close down the dine-in option but added their menu to Uber Eats to keep trading.  Uber Eats does take 30% of your revenue so having the ordering functionality through your website will earn you more. They have however agreed, due to public pressure, for restaurants to receive daily payments rather than once a week during the pandemic, and will scrap service fees on pick-up orders until 30 June.</p>
<p>Some business who have done this are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Attica </strong>&#8211; Beautiful meals delivered and wine selected by the head Somillier<br />
<a href="https://www.attica.com.au/delivery">https://www.attica.com.au/delivery</a></li>
<li>Wineries and cellar doors are begin to offer live wine tastings. <strong>WA Printhie Wines,</strong> Wine maker, Ed Swift view is &#8220;You can&#8217;t expect to keep operating in the same manner at a time like this, so we want to transfer our face-to-face cellar door experience to a safe online experience.”</li>
<li><strong>Relish Mama</strong> – Known in Bayside for the amazing cooking classes Nellie Kerrison has been running for years has added Ready-made meals to her offering as in person classes are now cancelled. Fresh or frozen and pick up or delivery. She is also looking at adding virtual cooking classes. <a href="https://relishmama.com.au/homemade-ready-made-meals/">https://relishmama.com.au/homemade-ready-made-meals/</a></li>
<li><strong>Scicluna’s</strong> is a fresh fruit and vegetable market and is now offering Grab &amp; Go boxes, either pick up or delivery from multiple locations. 3 ready packed boxes available. <a href="https://sciclunas.com.au/sciclunas-grab-go">https://sciclunas.com.au/sciclunas-grab-go</a></li>

<p>Most retail stores have an online presence already, the challenge now is to get found. If they don’t, now is the perfect time to add that revenue stream.<br />
Many local government councils are offering grants to finance this upgrade to your website.<br />
Check out the links below.</p>
<p>If your website doesn’t rank in Google you really need to consider Google Shopping or Google Ads to ensure your products get found. Consider adding these costs into any funding requests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Creative industries</strong></h2>
<p>The creatives industry includes artists, writers, hairdressers and beauticians.</p>
<p>Facebook is currently filled with businesses pivoting however it’s hard to find these services.</p>
<p>Some interesting ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>School holiday activities &#8211; virtual online art or writing classes</li>
<li>Artists can also apply to have an e-commerce facility added to their website – see here for details</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Fitness and Sports clubs</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-13532 aligncenter" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-Blog-Good-time-pliates.png" alt="Confetti-Design-Blog-Good-time-pliates" width="687" height="687" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-Blog-Good-time-pliates.png 687w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-Blog-Good-time-pliates-300x300.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-Blog-Good-time-pliates-150x150.png 150w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-Blog-Good-time-pliates-550x550.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" /></p>
<p>My own personal trainer has moved to zoom sessions in my home. It was just as hard and they even offered to drop off other weights or tools to offer variety.</p>

<h2><strong>Travel / Real Estate Industry</strong></h2>
<p>Local real estate agents Nick Johnstone have gone virtual. View the new wave in home selling in their video. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simone-chin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simone Chin </a> is an Licensed Estate Agent &amp; Auctioneer passionate about property and these social distancing constraints are not slowing her down! <a href="http://See the new way of buying and selling HERE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://vimeo.com/402855807</a></p>
<p>Turning luxury homes into safe holiday destinations, such as <a href="https://luxico.com.au/corporate-relocations-fully-furnished-executive-rentals/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw1Iv0BRDaARIsAGTWD1vzL5h3eRb1sKsUyF6NirQXU093wzyKJnN4_r3DA8GfLnI38KZi-YwaAoCiEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luxico</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Big Business</strong></h2>
<p>Small businesses aren&#8217;t the only ones adapting. With most large corporates all working virtually, there will be a need to maintain the culture and momentum regardless of staff location. Traditionally you would invest in team building exercises or events. Now Virtual Team Building is available and what a great initiative.<br />
In America a great new business in this area is Virtual Camp-fire nights. Although quite American the creativity is fantastic. This company&#8217;s offering includes “historic ghost stories, icebreaker questions, small competitions, and real s’mores.”</p>
<p><a href="https://teambuilding.com/events/tiny-campfire">https://teambuilding.com/events/tiny-campfire</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Resources</strong></h2>
<p>A range of <a href="https://www.myob.com/au/blog/covid-19-goverment-support-for-businesses/">stimulus packages at both State and Federal levels are being rolled out</a>. Keep an eye on the news to ensure you keep up to date with what you’re entitled to. In particular is the City of Melbournes investment into retailers who have been hit hard. View the grant details <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/melbourne-city-council-grants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
<p>A number of financial institutions have also offered interest freezes and discounts, so be sure to check what you can take advantage of with your own providers. Most banks are offering great terms to support business in this period.</p>

			<p>Learning how to network for business effectively is a very powerful tool for growth. Effective networking is all about developing valuable relationships over time. It’s about growing a pool of people who know about and value what you do.</p>
<p>The benefit of a good network is it gives you resources, inspiration, information, and connection to potential clients and referrals. As a small business owner it’s an important element of my marketing mix to regularly scheduling networking activities that increase my exposure and contacts.</p>
<p>This week’s blog article provides 7 ways to make networking easier, especially if social occasions make you anxious like me. These tips will help prepare you so you can network like a pro even if you are an introvert or inexperienced.</p>
<p>Practical tips</p>
<p><em><strong>Practice on people you are comfortable with</strong></em> If the idea of approaching people you don&#8217;t know intimidates you, begin your networking efforts by seeking out familiar faces, such as relatives and friends, at school and sporting occasions. A series of successful conversations will make you more confident in the process.</p>
<p><em><strong>Body Language</strong></em> It’s important to make eye contact and remember people’s names, so practice until you perfect this. Not only is this good manners, it is an easy way to show people they matter and you have been paying attention. Smile a warm authentic smile: it puts people at ease and we all look our best when we smile. Practice your handshake. Aim for firm but not a vice-like grip. Try to be the first to extend, indicates confidence and an interest in others.</p>
<p><em><strong>Presentation</strong></em> Make the effort to present yourself well as first impressions leave an impression. Dress so you are comfortable, yet look smart. Showing you care about your presentation communicates that you care about your business and clients. Have plenty of your business cards on hand and a pen.</p>
<p><em><strong>Be prepared</strong></em> Be very clear about who your potential client is, what they need and what problem you solve for them. Be able to describe your offer simply yet confidently. Be proud of what you offer, passion is compelling and magnetic. Be willing to share what you know, who you know and who you are in order to offer as much value as possible. Focus on what you can give rather than what you are hoping to gain. If networking makes you super anxious, write down a list of interesting questions to ask people you have just met that you might like to be asked. People particularly love to talk about themselves, so open questions work well and genuinely listen to people. A good listener is always valued. Think about anyone you know that the person you are talking to could benefit from meeting. People love people who love to help people.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><em><strong>Take it easy</strong></em> You will never meet everyone at large networking events. Trust that you will meet who you need to whether it be for your benefit or because you can add value to their business. Keep an eye out for the mover and shaker in the room, take advantage of their knowledge. Expert networkers are connectors and love connecting others. Even if you don’t know them, introduce yourself and talk a little about what brought you to the event and ask they know whom might be good for you to talk to.</p>
<p><em><strong>Follow up system</strong></em> Develop a system for keeping in touch or following up with people you connect with. Find simple ways to re-connect, whether it’s to follow through on a promise of an introduction, or an article on a topic you discussed. Make it natural, authentic and not too frequent. You are aiming to build a normal relationship that happens to provide an opportunity for both of you to benefit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Schedule networking</strong></em> Building a strong professional network takes time. Like a marathon it takes regular training efforts. The best approach is to schedule time each week to research events that suit your business goals, whether it’s for other likeminded business owners or to find customers. If It’s not scheduled it isn’t likely to happen in the regular fashion that makes a difference.</p>
<p>Networking is about building real relationships, actively maintaining them, and giving as much as you receive, without expecting anything in return.</p>
