			<p>This guide is for those of you who are not yet harnessing the power of Instagram or if you are already on Instagram check you have the following set up correctly to achieve your goals.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13629" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-IG-Sign-Up.png" alt="Confetti-Design-IG-Sign-Up" width="781" height="437" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-IG-Sign-Up.png 781w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-IG-Sign-Up-300x168.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-IG-Sign-Up-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Instagram Profile Optimisation</strong></h2>
<p>It is essential that your IG profile is fully optimised as this helps your brand attract attention organically.</p>
<p>There is no “right” way to craft your profile, these principles are a solid starting point based on<br />
Instagram’s best practices.</p>
<p>There are just a few things to consider to make your profile simple yet optimised.</p>
<ul>
<li>Profile photo: It’s best to use your company logo as your profile photo so people can easily<br />
identify your brand.</li>
<li>Account name: Make this your business name, identical to your brand’s other social profiles.</li>
<li>Username: This should also be your business name. Note that your username cannot have any spaces. You may find your ideal name is taken so a good alternative is to add the city to the end of your username.</li>
<li>Website: This is your website URL. It is the only clickable URL on your Instagram page.  Most businesses either use their website or link to their latest promotional page. Ideally it should be a trackable url so you can measure effectiveness of you campaigns and posts with calls to action.</li>
</ul>
<p>TIP – a clever tool to sign up for so you can have multiple links is <a href="https://linktr.ee">https://linktr.ee</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Bio: Your bio is where you will capture the attention of other users. You can either describe what your business does, hype up your website or slap your brand’s slogan here (or all of the above, actually).</li>
<li>Link your business Facebook page: Instagram will ask you to link your business Facebook page or create one. For those unaware, Facebook acquired Instagram a few years ago so there is more integration than ever with the two platforms. This makes sharing direct from Instagram to Facebook easy, it can do it automatically.</li>
</ul>

			<p><strong>Stories</strong><br />
Instagram Stories is a feature that lets you post photos and videos that vanish after 24 hours.<br />
Instagram Stories appear in a bar at the top of your feed — and all Instagram accounts can share stories.</p>
<p>When there’s something new to see, their profile photo will have a colorful ring around it.<br />
To view someone’s story, you simply need to tap on their profile photo, and their story will appear fullscreen, showing you all of the content they’ve posted in the last 24hrs, the content will play in chronological order from oldest to newest.</p>
<p>Once you’re viewing a story, you can tap to go back and forward or swipe to jump to another person’s story. Unlike regular posts, there are no likes or public comments.</p>
<p>This is an advanced Instagram user tool but we are mentioning it here in the profile set up because of what you can do with stories. Normally stories disappear after 24 hours.</p>
<p>One of the best things about stories is you can save them them as highlights in your profile. It is another way to bulk out your profile and add categories or added value to your customer..such as products, client stories, staff behind the scenes. It allows you to connect more with your audience and build out your following. Look at the page below to understand.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13630" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-IG-HIghlights.png" alt="Confetti-Design-IG-HIghlights" width="816" height="617" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-IG-HIghlights.png 816w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-IG-HIghlights-300x227.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-IG-HIghlights-768x581.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Stories views: How to check who’s seen your story</strong></p>
<p>Once your story is posted you can also view some basic analytics, to show you how many times each post in your story has been viewed and who has viewed it. When watching your own story, swipe up to check out this data and who’s seen each photo and video.</p>
<p><strong>How do I add a story to my Story Highlights?</strong></p>
<p>You can add stories to appear on your profile as highlights, even after they disappear. Highlights appear below your profile photo.</p>
<p>To add a story to a highlight:<br />
1. Go to your profile and tap Story Highights below your username and bio.<br />
2. Tap &#8220;+&#8221;<br />
3. Tap to select the story or stories you want to add to highlights, then tap Next.<br />
4. Choose a cover photo and enter a story name for your highlight, then tap Add (iPhone)<br />
or Done(Android). You can add more photos or videos to your highlight at any time by<br />
tapping Edit Highlight.</p>
<p>Note: Stories you add as highlights remain visible as highlights until you remove them, even after the original story has disappeared. Keep in mind that those you&#8217;ve allowed to see your story can also see your highlights.</p>
<p><strong>Branding hashtag:</strong><br />
Hashtags essentially act as a search function for Instagram to find relevant brands or products,<br />
information and people to follow. It rings true for users and businesses alike. And again, tapping into your target audience means getting specific so they can find you and your account comes up in user searches.</p>
<p>If you refer to your customer avatar answers you can consider what hashtags your customer might look for when getting inspiration. However if we were to look at generic hashtags pertaining to your business, there will be literally millions of posts.. you aren’t in all honesty going to get found using that. Rather than tackle the crowded hashtags, consider smaller more niche hashtags such as product based hashtags or location based ones. Also know what is trending for your customers.</p>
<p>The hard part is completed now for the fun part, creating your content plan and content.<br />
Read part 3 of our Instagram series to learn how to plan and design a feed that achieves your goals, engages your target audience and is the envy of your industry!</p>

			<p>When it comes to social media marketing, Instagram has been one of the platforms which skyrocketed the social media realm over the past few years. Gaining knowledge on how to make use of this platform to benefit your business through social media marketing will definitely be beneficial to your business.</p>
<p>There are three major areas in particular that you need to focus on to achieve your set goals: content planning, content creation and measurement.</p>
<h2>Content Plan</h2>
<p>Your content plan must refer back to your customer avatar completed in I<a href="/instagram-guide-start-right/">nstagram Guide – Start Right</a>.</p>
<p>You consider what is important to your customer and how can you engage them the most.</p>
<p>This may sound hard so we have broken into 2 steps.</p>
<p><strong>1. Your Instagram Topics</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> is to create topics to share about while keeping your customer in mind. Here are some<br />
typical topics.</p>
<ol>
<li>Education – educate on your product, how your business is giving the best value</li>
<li>Behind the scenes – your brand may very sophisticated and high end. Behind the scenes will be luxe images of staff at events or with customers. Your brand may be relaxed and your customer enjoys humour, as such your behind the scene might be more about jokes or bloopers. Can include getting to know each of your sales team. May include a mascot like your dog or something more unique. The goal of behind the scene is to give your feed personality, allowing your customer to relate and connect with you.</li>
<li>Product &#8211; the easiest topic but still keep in mind what your customer wants to see. What is their aspirational product? Are fashion trends important to them? Or what celebrities use/wear?</li>
<li>Offers – This topic might not be appropriate weekly but at least monthly you would be advised to post with a specific call to action. (A call to action is a particular action you want your customer to do)</li>
<li>Customers – User generated content, ask your customers if they would post while in store or to share their wedding images with you. This could include proposal images or unboxing videos.</li>
<li>Aspiration / Inspiration – celebrating other people in your industry maybe overseas or celebrities using your product or wearing a style that you offer</li>
<li>Topical – what is happening from a calendar perspective, both internationally and locally. This will often link into offers.</li>
</ol>
<p>The purpose of firstly creating topics is that it focusses your content creation. You can create content once a week in advance and then schedule it for certain days. It ensures hours aren’t wasted worrying about what to post. You can spend a couple of hours a month in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Plan the week and month</p>
<p>We have 7 topics above but you could start with 3 or 4 and post 3 times a week to begin.</p>
<p>Set out your calendar as shown below.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to look at content creation keeping in mind the topics, customer and your<br />
goals.</p>

			<h2>Creating Content</h2>
<p>The creating of content should following the themes asset out above and be in line with your brand, customer and your marketing goals. Sticking to it will not only build your brand identity but will also make your followers look forward to the next post.</p>
<p>To help illustrate this process this guide will take the sample plan above and build out content with actual post examples. Brand consistency is one of the main tips in making an Instagram feed looking beautiful. Even with the most beautiful of products such jewelry can look messy if you aren’t careful to be mindful of your brand consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Monday &#8211; Topic 1. – Education</strong></p>
<p>Examples of post:<br />
DID YOU KNOW?</p>
<p>Sharing your expertise on a product line your company is offering. You can provide the history on why your product is popular, when and where is was first used, and the like. . The beauty of  these kinds of posts is that you can do a two image post and on slider that directly relates to the product you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday &#8211; Topic 2. – Aspiration</strong></p>
<p>Examples of post:<br />
Who is wearing what?</p>
<p>Posting about celebrities or known people who are using your product is a good aspiration post.  The key to this type of post is to ensure you consult your customer avatar to see who they  admire. If they are old-school elegance then Grace Kelly inspired posts might be appropriate. If your audience is young millennials then younger actors will be better. Don’t forget to tag the celebrity accounts and use hashtags.</p>
<p>What else is your customer looking for?<br />
This is where you can also link in with other brands / retailers in your local area. Sharing beautiful products or ideas that you customer will find useful is an ideal post for this topic. The added benefit is you tag the other businesses involved, it means your post exposure is increased.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday &#8211; Topic 3. – Behind the scene</strong></p>
<p>Have fun with this. Really show off who you are as a brand while keeping at the forefront who your customer is.</p>
<p>An example could be your morning tea for the staff or a birthday, or shooting your latest video/ image. It can be a video of your sales team re-merchandising after a great sales experience..  You can even speed up the video for a fun twist.</p>
<p><strong>Friday &#8211; Topic 4. – Product</strong></p>
<p>Product might seem an easy post topic. However here are a couple of pointers:</p>
<p>a. include your offers and use Linkt.ree to take them directly to the offer<br />
b. as always keep your customer front of mind<br />
c. as a brand manager we would ask you “what do you want to be known for?”<br />
then share those products more often.<br />
d. Keep the posts clean and elegant</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you can add more topics such as Saturday quotes. However it can be overwhelming to come up with the posts and keep up with the regularity so starting with 3 or 4 is a good ideas. Managing the content creation and the posting can be shared amongst your team too. However ensure you are careful with how your brand is portrayed on your page.</p>
<p>To illustrate how to pull these all together see a make-over of a feed below using the same topics as our example above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other general content tips</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. People Focused</strong><br />
Instagram is a platform where people share their experiences with other people. The photos posted in your Instagram account shouldn’t just be about selling your products—your content should always involve people, as this shows that your product is being enjoyed by real- life individuals.<br />
This can include customers, staff, suppliers, celebrities, local businesses</p>
<p><strong>2. Brand consistency / colour &amp; tone</strong><br />
The most successful Instagram pages are those that are consistently portraying the brand. By brand we mean values, colours of the logo and brand, consistency with their marketing collateral including website. The tone of the feed is also very similar. By this we mean they stick to a colour palate of 2 or 3 colours.</p>
<p>If your brand is navy and grey and the audience is average income earning living in seaside suburbs, you might share images that include lots of shades of blue and softer sandy colours. However you would not create content with reds and oranges. You might be less likely to create content with vibrant bright red and green.</p>
<p><strong>3. Narrative</strong><br />
With each post create a story or share a personal comment that you know will engage your follower and target audience. The most engaged posts are statistically those that have a few sentences relating to the topic, weaving in your brand story, customer or brand personality. Remember to always use hashtags too.</p>
<p><strong>4. Followers, Locations, and Brands Tagging</strong><br />
One of the best practices of successful brands using Instagram is also to regram the posts of their followers and tag these followers in the process. This encourages your followers to post more about your product, and they also market your products with their own followers by doing so.<br />
If you have a brick-and-mortar store or if you are regularly having events, using location- specific posts will allow you to discover new fans and prospective followers.</p>
<p>Apart from followers and locations, you should also tag other brands and accounts and hopefully give you a shout-out, too. These relevant tags are indirect ways of encouraging promotion.</p>
<p><strong>5. Cross promote using other Social Media Platforms</strong><br />
Aside from using your content in your Instagram platform, it will also be beneficial to use these contents to your other social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. It doesn’t just give you more ROI out of your Instagram presence, but you are also maximizing the reach of your content.</p>
<p><strong>6. Products and Promotions</strong><br />
With wedding season or new product launch plan the posts that lead up to it to build interest. Mark events with promotions to help achieve your goals and drive visitors to your online store to redeem discount coupons. Always include a sign up with the calls to action on your site so you can capitalize on using their email address to email market at a later stage.</p>
<p><strong>7. Giveaways and Contests</strong><br />
Studies show that brands that run contests grow their followers count faster than those who don’t. We know that giveaway- related posts receive huge amount of engagements, and this is one effective way to increase your followers and fans and achieve those goals.</p>
<p><strong>8. Paid Ads</strong><br />
Let’s not disregard the potential of running paid ads on Instagram. There have been many success stories of brands that use Instagram ads by using Instagram Stories and videos to grab the attention of users. You should start doing research first about Instagram ads and familiarize yourself with the process before using this paid ad, though. Remember to know your goals and the metrics that you’ll be looking at to ensure that you’ll be able to steer your marketing strategy to the right direction. Paid ads targeting a local demographic and for product specials are a good place to start.</p>
<p><strong>9. Consider working with influencers</strong><br />
Influencer marketing involves a paid association with another Instagram account with a substantial and engaged follower count. The influencers’ followers allow you to tap into a new group of users that you’re trying to engage. It functions like an ad because the relationship is paid for. However, if you find the right influencer for your business, it can certainly be a fruitful way to increase your sales as well as grow your number of followers.</p>

<h3>Measurement</h3>
<p>If we backtrack a bit to <a href="/instagram-guide-start-right/">Instagram Guide- Start Right</a> where you set your SMART goal, we needed to be able to measure activity to show how successful the return on investment has been both in expenditure or time and energy.</p>
<p><strong>Instagram can offer you insights within the app.</strong><br />
One of the most valuable tools you get is the free analytics tools. In Instagram Insights, you will be able to see key information about your follower’s demographics and the time they are most active on the platform. Similarly, you can view your top performing posts and stories, which will give you a better idea of the type of content that your followers find most interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Bitly</strong><br />
Using link services like <a href="https://www.bitly.com">https://www.bitly.com</a> can help you track particular campaigns or links to offers or product promotions.</p>
<p><strong>Foot traffic</strong><br />
As you are brick and mortar businesses your goal is ideally to get more foot traffic, as such having a coupon that has to be redeemed in store is a great measure of the success of any promo.</p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong><br />
Your website must have analytics tracking codes as this will also show the statistics of people coming from your Instagram account into your site and to which pages. If they land on a page that is an offer but they bounce (meaning they click off immediately) it is vital you consider what  message your website is giving. You don’t want to re-vamp your Instagram account only to send potential customers to your website which is not communicating the same brand message or level of sophistication your customer is expecting.</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have your pick of social media platforms, but for retailers the most successful and popular at the moment is Instagram. In the US 71% of businesses are on Instagram, there is no denying it is the place to be, and the visual nature of Instagram makes it likely to be the leader for a while to come.<br />
If you are not on Instagram then read up on our easy to follow steps so you start the right way. If you are already a gun on ‘the gram’ then these tips will be a good checklist to make sure you stay at the top of your game!<br />
This guide will take you through the 4 steps to starting in Instagram the right way that will make both the returns for your efforts and the on-going management so much easier.<br />
</span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 – Understanding your customer</strong></h3>
<p>Before you even think of creating the account, you want to get crystal clear on who your jewelry customer is. Truly understanding your target market is one of the most crucial things in running a successful business. It is only by having a clear idea in your mind of who you would like to reach, sell to or help that you can tailor and target your messages to have the strongest impact on your audience.</p>
<p>This has to be the key step that underpins your future success on Instagram. And really any marketing activity. Without it all your posting is like a scatter gun approach and the likelihood of connecting with your audience is slim.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you need to know your customer so clearly?</strong></p>
<p>1. You can create content to engage and connect with them when you have them in the forefront of your mind.<br />
2. You can ask yourself ‘will our perfect customer relate to this, be inspired to act, feel an emotional connection, be moved, feel like we ‘get them?’<br />
3. If you wish to use influencers, knowing who your customer is ensures you pick the right influencer.<br />
4. Engaging in cross promotions is easier as you look for other businesses who share the same customer.<br />
5. Although not a direct impact on your Instagram activity, knowing WHERE your customer hangs out or what they do in their life can guide your traditional marketing efforts. Local cafes to be linked with, event venues, magazines to advertise in. When you know where your customer spends their life means you can position yourself literally in their sight!</p>
<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>
<p>• What are your customer’s values? What is important to them?<br />
• What is their lifestyle? Or how do they spend their time? What is important to them?<br />
• What is their age?<br />
• Where do they live?<br />
• Is there a specific gender you serve more than another? – Who is really doing the research on your product?<br />
• What brands do they love?<br />
• Where do they eat, holiday, shop regularly?<br />
• What are their aspirations?<br />
• What magazines do they read, films watch, Netflix shows?</p>
<p><strong>The Problems</strong></p>
<p>• List all the problems you solve for your customers?<br />
• What emotions do they feel at the exact moment they discover your store and service?<br />
• What specific words and phrases are they saying to themselves or using to friends when describing how it feels to discover your service?</p>
<p><strong>The Solutions</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter whether you could realistically deliver or create these experiences, the goal is simply to unlock your imagination and challenge yourself to step into your customer’s shoes and see things in a new way. These insights will help with the type of content you create and how you try to engage your customers via Instagram.<br />
Before they found you what was their reality as it relates to buying a product like yours?<br />
• How were they trying to solve the problem?<br />
• Where were they looking to find a solution?<br />
• Who were they talking to in order to find a solution?<br />
• How was it impacting their personal life?<br />
• Have they tried other solutions before?<br />
• Why did that solution not work for them? Why are they still looking?<br />
• What do they wish Jewelers understood about them?<br />
• What is your customer’s dream? In their ideal world, what’s their ultimate fantasy of how your product or service would be delivered?<br />
• Do they have barriers to purchase from you?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions help build out a real picture of your target audience/s. Now you have this ‘persona’ or ‘ideal customer’ described it’s useful to even go to the extent of naming them, find images from magazines to visualize the perfect customers. It may be that you base this avatar on one of your best customers. In fact you could go to your most loyal customer and ask them to help answer the questions.</p>
<p>You not only have an amazing understanding of who you need to connect with via your posts, you also have a huge amount of content right in those answers. To see how we use all this fantastic insights be sure to download the guide called Instagram – Creating Content That Engages.<br />
Now we move onto the goal setting step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Set Your Goals</strong></h3>
<p>Now you have a good idea of who you want to become your brand follower, come into your store or click through to your website, you want to get your goals clear. The reason we do this is that having a clear goal or 2 or 3 goals allows you to purposefully create content and more chance of achieving the set goals.</p>
<p>Haphazardly posting is not a viable strategy when it comes to Instagram for business. Once you define who is your customer you need to define what it is your brand wants to do, then you can begin to better speak the language of your followers.</p>
<p><strong>How to Create a Social Media Goal</strong></p>
<p>Use the oldie-but-goodie SMART technique to set your goals.</p>
<p>S- <strong>Specific </strong></p>
<p>Goals should be clear and simple, but very detailed in terms of what you want to happen.</p>
<p>NOT SPECIFIC &#8211; increase our followers<br />
SPECIFIC &#8211; increase our followers by 100% by end of month August 2019</p>
<p>M- <strong>Measurable </strong></p>
<p>You will need to have a goal that you can measure, and there are a lot of social media tools that can help you measure the success of your strategy such as Instagram Insights. Ensure your website has analytics so you can track the number of new users that come from your Instagram account to specific product pages.</p>
<p>You can use a tool like Bitly.com that is a unique trackable url you can put into your bio.<br />
If you would like more reading on this..here is an article that lists 8 Instagram Analytics Tools <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/instagram-analytics-tools/">https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/instagram-analytics-tools/</a></p>
<p>A- <strong>Action Oriented </strong></p>
<p>This part is where you’ll create actionable task that will turn your goal into reality. Your “plan of attack will be detailed here as you create your goal.</p>
<p>An example of a goal is to increase the traffic to your store or online store that results in 20 new sales directly via your Instagram account in the month of August. This goal could include the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post offers that are redeemed in store or online</li>
<li>Post blogs</li>
<li>Post new products</li>
<li>Linked In-store activities – launch of a new product or a joint wedding dress fashion show with local bridal boutique in your store</li>
<li>Post snippet of a video with full length video on the website</li>
</ul>
<p>R- <strong>Realistic </strong></p>
<p>With all your resources on hand (time, money, people), is the goal you’re setting realistic? This is what you need to keep in mind when creating your goal. This is where you may reduce your goal or look to outsource some tasks to achieve the goals.</p>
<p>T- <strong>Time Bound </strong></p>
<p>Every goal needs a deadline, otherwise it’s not a goal—it’s a wishful thinking. Keeping in mind the complexity of the actions, as well as your resources, create a time frame that is both suitable to the goal as well as realistic.</p>

			<p><strong>You can create just a few goals to avoid being overwhelmed. Some of the most common Social Media goals are: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased brand awareness</li>
<li>Drive sales through traffic to your website</li>
<li>Drive sales through traffic to your store</li>
<li>Demonstrate company culture</li>
<li>Showcase your team and recruit new talent</li>
<li>Increase customer engagement and loyalty</li>
<li>Showcase products</li>
<li>Share company or industry news</li>
<li>Build a more engaged community</li>
<li>Connect with influencers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An example in action </strong></p>
<p>Let’s look at an example of a SMART goal for Increase Brand Awareness in the next 2 months:</p>
<p><strong>Specific- </strong>Build up brand awareness of the new website within two-month period</p>
<p><strong>Measurable- </strong>Reach 1,000 traffic increase in the next month and another 1,000 the following month.</p>
<p><strong>Action Oriented &#8211; </strong>Create pre-launch content to be posted to build momentum. Encourage pre-launch sign up for a discount or advanced warning of specials. During the first week of a product launch, create a post every 2 days with calls to action to the new website, sharing reviews, new product, video’s of users with product, unboxing experiences or blog posts on related topics to the launch and product. This can include paid sponsored ads</p>
<p><strong>Realistic &#8211; </strong></p>
<p>✓ Ads Budget : 8 week period x 2.5 posts a week x $10 = $200</p>
<p>✓ Content writer and graphic designer hired to create materials</p>
<p><strong>Time Bound- </strong>2 month period with check point of 1 month</p>
<p><strong>Set Your Baseline </strong></p>
<p>It is important that before you take any actions in your social media account against this goal that you have set your starting point. This means that you have the data from an analytics point of view on where you’re currently at (traffic to your site, bounce rates, particular page visits.) so that you’ll know exactly how your statistics are improving after implementing your actions.</p>
<p><strong>Check Points </strong></p>
<p>Lastly, set up check points to review your statistics so that you’ll see which is working or not. Is the ad budget boosting enough or reaching your preferred audience? Or is brand awareness really what you should focus on? You can check the social media and google analytics that you’ve set to gauge and evaluate your efforts.</p>
<p>Now you have a goal or set of goals you need a clear strategy to achieve these. However before we embark on that we need to do the one thing that makes all of our efforts easier, understanding our customer.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Now you have a clear vision of the customer to attract and a goal or set of goals your next step is to create a social media strategy. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Let’s recap </strong>– Goal #1 &#8211; Increase Brand Awareness in next 2 months</p>
<p>It is tricky to translate your social media efforts into sales especially when you’re in a brick and mortar business. However not including a social media strategy is effectively ignoring a huge portion of the potential customers.</p>
<p>Common metrics that can be measured are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of followers</li>
<li>Number of clicks through to the website from Instagram</li>
<li>Number of sales using unique Instagram promo code</li>
<li>Number of tags on other pages</li>
<li>Number of check ins</li>
<li>Number of comments</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instagram strategies to achieve this goal could be: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build content themes to speak to a problem of target audience</li>
<li>Share products your customer loves more than any others</li>
<li>Create articles that are indirectly related to your product but your customer would find helpful. Link these articles to your website, include the products on the blogs as an indirect selling opportunity</li>
<li>Share reviews that overcome barriers your customers have</li>
<li>Run a competition for free tickets to an event your customer would love to go to in your local area. One of the great benefits of having a location centric business is your customer is near you</li>
<li>Include your customers in video or in user generated content</li>
<li>Offer rewards for customers who share an unboxing image or video tagging you</li>
<li>Implement Instagram shopping on your website and linked to your account</li>
<li>Engage an influencer who shares your customer</li>
<li>Share other Instagram pages and content that your customer audience also follows to broaden your reach</li>
<li>Always reply or like any comments</li>
<li>Uncover niche hashtags that your customer is also following. Similarly, location-specific hashtags are perfect for zeroing in on an audience in your own neighborhood.</li>
<li>Consider the time of day to share when you know your audience is on the platform. Set up a schedule for posting so you are also not on it 24/7!</li>
<li>Tell stories to captivate your audience, the narrative of your brand is just as important as your customer in your content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list can go on.. but you have a comprehensive guide now of how to get started right, even before you set your account. The next guide will cover setting up your account and then the final in the series is about creating the content with purpose to achieve your goals.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have put together five main reasons why your e-commerce website needs a blog.</p>
<p>A lot of things should be considered when maintaining a high performing e-commerce website. One important element you must consider is creating and maintaining a blog. A place to share articles, tips, resources or how to videos. Basically any kind of content to add value to your customers.  Fresh regular content helps your website remain relevant,  allowing you to build your brand voice and increase awareness of you and your products.</p>
<h2><strong><br />
1. Search Engine Optimisation</strong></h2>
<p>A well written blog ensures that there is educative content that can be indexed by search engines. It ultimately helps your online store be more searchable by related topics, hence generating more visitors to your site.</p>
<p>Blogs help enhance the quality of SEO since it points appropriate answers of customer inquiries to your website. Blog posts that use quality SEO tactics such as targeting relevant keywords, placing them strategically on titles, and writing appropriate meta data descriptions give your e-commerce site the opportunity to rank in search engines—and this is always good for business! If this term is sounding foreign, read <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/seo-services-melbourne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our SEO services </a> to help understand it more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>2. Increase Traffic on your Website</strong></h2>
<p>As a business owner, your goal is to pique the interest of your target market, so that they will visit your site and increase your chances of making a sale. Posting your blog links in social media increases your chances to accomplish that goal.</p>
<p>Create a blog which is catchy, informative, and up to date. Posting these blog links in your store’s social media accounts will serve as an ad for your website. Depending on how useful your blogs are to the readers, the blog link will generate clicks and drive visitors /  traffic to your website, which is a big step towards increasing your sales!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. Brand Identity</strong></h2>
<p>There are numerous steps into starting up your brand identity. You’ll have to think about your niche, your market, a catchy <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/how-to-name-small-business/">brand name</a>, and most especially—building your brand identity.</p>
<p>When you think about a product, a specific brand usually comes to mind. For example, when thinking about carbonated drinks or soft drinks, you’ll probably think about Coca Cola. Or when thinking about toothpaste, you’ll immediately think about Colgate. These brands established their identity throughout the years by executing effective marketing strategies, which helped them gain the trust and loyalty of their customers. Same can be done with e-commerce websites. A blog is another tool to use in establishing your identity in a world full of rival brands and similar products.</p>
<p>Blogging provides a voice to your business.  You can use it to build your business’s unique personality which separates you from your competitors. Things to consider are what do you want to be known for that are also important to your customer? How can you give personality and life to your brand through your writing?  Your initial blogs could include answers to the basic identity questions: 1- who are you, and 2- what value your product or service gives to your customers. These will be ingrained in your readers’ minds as you write more and more articles on your website. In time, your readers may become your customers and eventually, your brand ambassadors!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>4. Build an Online Community</strong></h2>
<p>If you keep posting helpful and relative blogs consistently, your community of readers which are originally your searchers will keep going back to your site for new information. The comments that your viewers leave in your blog will spark a meaningful conversation with like minded people about the topics.</p>
<p>Blogs that are personalized and relatable are the ones readers usually react to. Make your blogging as inclusive and interactive as possible, specially when you are trying to build a community of brand supporters. Write about how your product contributes or solves a problem in their life. Encourage comments and conversations within your blog as these will also help in making your blog rank higher in related topics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5. Enhance Your Writing Skills</strong></h2>
<p>As important as having including a blog in your e-commerce website is, making sure your content is relevant and easy to read it also vital. Writing them doesn’t just keep you well connected to your business and your brand, but also helps develop your communication skills.</p>
<p>Here are some factors to consider when you are starting to write a blog for your online store:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your relevance. </strong>If not talking about products or services you offer, your blog should always have a connection to what your online store is offering.</li>
<li><strong>Your audience. </strong>Some blog writers are so used to using technical terms that they forget to consider who the target audience is. Basic rule is to make sure your writing style is conversational and simple. A common standard is aim for it to be understood by a high schooler! Writing like the way you talk is often a great start. Ultimately the goal is to engage your target audience so they stay on your site for longer.</li>
<li><strong>Your structure. </strong>Keep a structure which allows your audience to fully digest your blog content. The basic structure of a blog is 1-having an introduction of the topic, 2- giving more details about the topic and sub topics, and finally, summarising the main message of your blog. Structure using a hierarchy of information is also important for ranking. Google is more likely to rank your articles if they are structures logically.</li>
<li><strong>Your consistency</strong>. Decide on whether you will write a blog on a weekly or a monthly basis. This will not only help you rank higher in search engines—it will also keep your customers informed of the current trends and news about your business. This will gain more engagement to your current and future customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The e-commerce world is growing rapidly, hence the continued importance of having a blog for your website. You may start with simple blogs and then later evolve to longer ones and don&#8217;t forget you can also include video, images or infographics. What is important though is you start now and reap its benefits not only for your online store but also to your ranking. With all these gains (and nothing to lose), why don’t you start blogging now?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How to create great blogging topics</h2>
<p>Getting ideas for blogging is super easy. You will not realise it but everyday people are giving you ideas, the trick is to start thinking like your customer and noticing what is going on around you.</p>
<h3>Use these&nbsp;10 ideas for your blogs:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Keep a list with questions from clients, customer service questions, questions you’ve been asked on social media.<br />
2. Look at the calendar and break up the year into seasons, holidays, industry events – what times of the year have an impact on your customer in relation to your services.<br />
3. Pay attention to what is topical and in the news. Is there new legislation or some event happening that has an impact on your customer that you can add insight, help or advice?<br />
4. Human element &#8211; stories about your business, or your customers or your life that has bearing on your customers life and interests.<br />
5. What are top 20 problems your customers have and write to solve them, research resources to help them with these.<br />
6. Scan Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and forums to see what your prospects are talking about and asking about.<br />
7. Share a board on Pinterest of pins that your client might find useful. These could be related or unrelated to your services. If your goal is to connect with your prospect you want to build trust by common interests and shared experiences.<br />
8. Look for what your tribe find amusing, entertaining.<br />
9. You could also give people a little bit of a peek behind the scenes, see you in action in a video.<br />
10. Create a series of videos or recordings of how to – that help your customer or prospect.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past year I have designed a couple of landing pages and while doing so I collated a list of do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts.</p>
<p>What is a landing page you may ask? A landing page is the page that visitors see after clicking on your Facebook ad, promotional email or if you provided a link in a traditional marketing piece. It can be a specific page on your website or a separate page created exclusively for search engines. A landing page is designed to direct visitors to take a specific action, such as making a purchase, completing a registration, or subscribing to your mailing list.</p>
<p>When I design a website I spend a lot of time considering the client, their personality, their brand and equally their customer. Every design element must meet these 2 criteria. The desired result is for the pages to connect with the visitor so they will feel trust and thus pick the phone or act.</p>
<p>When it comes to designing a landing page or sales page we have to also consider the key elements to convert a visitor into am more targeted action, the action of signing up and paying on the spot.</p>
<p>The 2 of these goals may sound the same but when it comes to design, copy and photography they are subtly different. This is no better time to employ a copywriter with landing page expertise.</p>
<h3>Lets take a look at key elements of how to design a landing page that converts:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Headline</strong><br />
For a high converting landing page, the headline must be very visible, the first thing your visitor sees and it must offer a benefit. Keep your headline succinct, straight to the point and create urgency to the visitor acts then and there.<br />
Ensure it is the same headline you use in the ads or links that get your customer to this page. They acted on a certain headline best not to confuse them into thinking they have been directed to an incorrect page by being tricky with your headlines.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Supporting sub-headline</strong><br />
A sub-headline will give people a reason to read your entire copy, instead of skimming or scanning it. Keep repeating this sub-headline to reinforce the benefit and to give context to the attention grabbing main headline. Use simply language.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>One focal point</strong><br />
The brain processes visual information quicker than text. Just as an artist or interior designer always has one feature you notice more so should your landing page. Always add a visual focus to your landing page, such as your headshot, the product or a short video of benefits.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>One call to action</strong><br />
The purpose of a landing page it to entice a visitor to take ONE specific action. The action needs to be highly visible as a button to subscribe, download, purchase, share or a form to complete. More options you offer of actions the less you will see convert. The language needs to be simple and clear. The colour you choose as the button may need to be tested. <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/what-are-the-best-converting-cta-button-colours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a> is another blog about the use of colour to help.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Remove distractions</strong><br />
A landing or sales page there is no navigation, no clutter, menu’s, links or extra buttons. The purpose is for the visitor to see the benefits, identify as someone who needs the solution you offer and then act on that message. You don’t want them navigation away or delaying with confusing messaging.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">In particular these are other things you should keep off your page:<br />
a. links to other parts of your sites such as “about” or “contact”<br />
b. any pictures or images that don’t relate to the offer; these will only serve as distractions<br />
c. small sized font, must be at least 14 px<br />
d. any links along the lines of “click here to subscribe” or “click here to read more.” If you can’t cram all your content into the upper fold of your landing page, just let the user scroll down. Scrolling is almost always better than clicking to the next page.<br />
e. scary forms with unnecessary fields such as “title” or “fax”<br />
f. “clear fields” button</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are always exceptions and you usually can’t copy best practices to use on your site, but this advice given here should be your starting point. Get the essentials in place first, and tweak from there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Customer/client testimonials or social proof</strong><br />
Add in testimonials to prove what you are offering. Testimonials can also overcome barriers to purchase. See my blog <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/10-tips-get-powerful-testimonials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a> for more on that.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Maintain your brand</strong><br />
Keep your landing pages looking as similar to your website as possible. Your brand is still communicating all the principles of you and connecting in the same way we are simply guiding them to act more definitively on a sales page. Keep the same colors, font – the overall look and feel of your main site. This helps to enforce the brand awareness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Length<br />
</strong>Long or short? Answer these questions: How much money are you asking for or how complex is the decision making process? How much emotion is involved? Or what level of anxiety is involved? The rule of thumb is the more you ask for the longer the page. The greater investment emotionally or time or financially the more you will need to include. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Testing</strong><br />
You will need to always test what colours, copy and images you have used. There is no magic wand as your customer will respond to your offering differently to others. Here are a couple of guides to help you understand A/B testing:<br />
1. <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/the-ultimate-guide-to-a-b-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ultimate Guide To A/B Testing</a><br />
2. <a href="http://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-ab-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is A/B Testing?</a></p>
<p>We have identified the 9 key principles in designing your landing page now finally ensure you don’t break these 2 rules before you go live:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"># 1. Never send traffic to your home page<br />
To get people to your sales page you will need to market it on social media or traditional print or email marketing. The purpose of the sales page is create the urgency and get the customer to act, therefore you never drive traffic onto your website’s home page. Your homepage has a navigation where the visitor will go wandering and can easily exit before finding your offer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">#2: Make it relevant to YOUR customer<br />
We have just seconds before a visitor makes a decision about whether our offer is useful or relevant. They will click away if they can’t find what they want or if it doesn’t entice easily without effort on their part. Confusion or miss-targeting will result in abandonment and no sales or sign ups.</p>
<p>Rather than let that happen, make the few seconds you have their attention count and answer the questions that are on their mind:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Does this place have what I am looking for?</em><br />
<em>Do they understand me?</em><br />
<em>Is there enough information?</em><br />
<em>Can I trust this person / business or product?</em><br />
<em>How long &amp; much will this all take?</em></p>
<p>Your landing page must entice visitors to stay and complete the desired action for conversion, whether it’s filling out a subscription form or buying a product. Before you send your request off to your designer to get working on your landing page get the copy right. Sit down and create it on a blank page with a pen and map it out and answer these 2 questions.</p>
<p>This will save you lots of time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1: Who is my target audience?<br />
</strong>Make sure the landing page talks to a specific audience. Know the problem, the need and want your target audience has. You want to write the words with a particular person in mind.<br />
<span style="color: #cb0044;"><em>If aren’t too sure about this then you my <a style="color: #cb0044;" href="https://confettidesign.com.au/starting-a-small-business/">Clarity Process </a>is a must. Read about the effectiveness here in identifying your competitive advantage and defining who your target customer is.</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2: What do I want them to do?<br />
</strong>Define the desire action. This is the one action people should take when landing on the page. What is the sole outcome you want for this page? Opt-in to build your list, purchase a product, attend a webinar?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3: What is my message?<br />
</strong>You know your audience, the problem they have and the solution you can offer, write a simple and an easily understood message. This message will need to be tested but you have to start somewhere but above all else be straight forward, keep the tricky language out!</p>
<p>Once you have these you can either send it to a designer, like me! Or do it yourself by following the 7 key principles above. Good luck and don’t forget to test and measure!<br />
Below is an info graph to give you a visual representation of how the principles in action.</p>

			<p>Jo Mackay of Rockstars Speaker fame has a new venture in 2015, <a title="Fierce Foxy Free" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/fiercefoxyfree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fierce Foxy &amp; Free</a>.<br />
She hosted a recent lunch with some local business women and 2 speakers. One speaker we heard from Tarnya Cook, Editor of <a href="http://contentmagazine.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Australian Content Magazine</a>, shared her 3 tips on raising your profile. A goal of mine this year.</p>
<p><strong>Tarnya’s 3 tips were:</strong><br />
1. Find your passion and take action<br />
2. Use your social media platforms, chose two and set goals to achieve (she recommends Instagram)<br />
3. Seek out opportunities to be seen both online and offline (article contributions, speaking, networking)</p>
<p>What I enjoyed about this list was we focus on what works for us. Each of our paths is different and we each bring unique skills to our paths, so our choices will need to be different too. There will always be some similarities and things that worked for me, work for you, but on the whole I have to carve out what I will try.</p>
<p>Therefore thinking about #1 how do we do that exactly. Well I have observed people and when they talk about certain parts of their business they get really excited, passionate, enthusiastic and thier voice changes. I would ask others what they think it is for you if you have trouble identifying it.</p>
<p>Number #2<br />
I agree about the goal aspect. What is a business goal? Increase your list, increase your sales by x by x?<br />
Then consider where is your customer mostly hanging out? Which social media platform do you enjoy the most. I am a firm believer in what you give out comes back in multiple. It’s energy out, energy in. Applying that principle, if you love a social media platform and you tweak your value based activity to suit your goal and customer, you may find that you reach you goals better than if you plugged away at something that is arduous and heavy in energy.</p>
<p>Number #3<br />
I was at a training event recently where a lady was bemoaning the fact she is always being asked to write for National Newspapers and magazines, yet they don’t want to pay her. Everyone else in the room’s mouth dropped. We were all thinking the same thing, “you get asked to do that and you are unhappy they don’t want to pay you?” FREE PUBLICITY my dear!<br />
We aren’t all as lucky as this woman, yet we can put ourselves out there to ask if anyone would like contributors.<br />
This has been a key point in my marketing plan to date and I am happy with the results of taking this approach. Networking at events where my customers are, offering to provide content when publications either request or not, both off and online.<br />
Offering to participate in workshops as a free speaker.</p>
<p>Tarnya’s 3 tips to raise your profile are great and most effective when we start with the end in mind. If you are like me and work around school drop off and pick up, we have to be very careful of our time and not spend countless hours in activity that leads know where. Start with a goal then look at these three things and choose your activity. Love to hear how you get on.</p>

			<h5 class="">In Part 4 we consider the importance of knowing your customer to then research and uncover where they hang out so you know where and how to find customers for your business.</h5>
<p>For many of us starting out as small business owners we are a jack-of-all-trades, doing all manner of jobs; accounts, designer, writer, sales person, IT, customer service, cleaner, filing clerk, the roles go on.<br />
It can be quite a juggling act, exhilarating and yet exhausting. As the customers start to roll in there is a feeling of relief that our idea was truly a success. But it can’t stop there, even for the most successful, we still need to keep the marketing, talking, investing in activities that develop our sales pipeline or funnel.</p>
<p>In this 6-part series we have looked at a few areas of how to maintain a steady stream of customers. This piece is about your marketing focus being aimed exactly where your customers are both on and offline.</p>
<p>Another way to keep your sales funnel full is by being very efficient with your time. Understanding we want to work smarter not harder, consider where your special, unique customer ‘hangs out’.</p>
<p>This is not meant in as slang, but rather literally place yourself, either physically or online, where your customers spend their time. When we place ourselves, our brand and our products where our customers are present we are in prime position to be talked about, remembered, referred to others or to have our products purchased.</p>
<p>The way to figure this out if of course to know who your customer is intimately. If this is your first time reading my articles, first go <a title="HOW TO MAINTAIN A STEADY STREAM OF CUSTOMERS – A 6 PART SERIES: PART 1" href="https://confettidesign.com.au/how_to_maintain_a_steady_stream_of_customers/">here</a> to define your customer.<br />
Without this step completed, you could be spending your time in all the wrong places and marketing to people who don’t need your product, don’t get ‘you’ or what you are about, because as we know not everyone is going to be ‘our’ customer i.e. a big waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s an example:</strong></p>
<p>If you create highly designed, edgy, modern, musician inspired printed t-shirts and you currently sell online but also want to wholesale to a retailer. When considering the best location for a retailer it’s not going to be in a conservative suburb with an elderly demographic. Your most suitable location will be in a suburb with a younger demographic where there&#8217;s live music venues and good shopping strips and hip happening cafe&#8217;s. To get exposure you would consider Music Festivals or markets, advertising on JJJ , PBS or dressing staff in a groovy café. Consider you may have more than one type of market, your t-shirts may appeal to middle aged married men who want to re-live their youth, ask yourself where do they hang out on weekends? When &amp; where do they do their shopping? Does their wife shop for them, where does she hang out?</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s another example:</strong></p>
<p>If you want to open an upmarket hair salon aimed at middle aged women with disposable income. You would design the interiors with them in mind, subtle and sophisticated. You would play music not too loud or ‘heavy’. You would open it in a suburb where you have easy access to this kind of demographic.</p>
<p><strong>Think of every element of this demographic and ask yourself questions like:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• What is the age range for my target audience?<br />
• Where is my target audience located?<br />
• Are they male, female or both?<br />
• What are the occupations of my target audience?<br />
• What to they do in their spare time?<br />
• What does their day look like?<br />
• What are their movements?<br />
• Where to they go and how do they get there?</p>
<p>Once you have identified your customer’s behaviour you can use this to help you determine where they spend their time most.<br />
Now you can target your marketing activity in the right places to people who are really interested in what you have to offer.<br />
Depending on the type of business you are running, your locations will be either physical, online or a combination of both. Look for local publications and online communities where you can contribute articles or information to increase your exposure. Consider joint ventures that increase your profile to your target audience. Remember to ask questions regarding what is available, you never know unless you ask!</p>
<p><strong>Physical Location:</strong><br />
Those who have a physical business most commonly use physical locations to hang out with their customers. Research and look for events or places specific to your field that will host your customers.<br />
For example, the owner of a beauty salon going through this research will discover that they target their customer at local beauty expos, beauty warehouses, gyms, local cafes and Chamber of Commerce events, local street trader association events and even places like school fundraisers.</p>
<p><strong>Online Presence:</strong><br />
With the recent increase in the use of the internet, both physical and online companies can interact with their target audience online through social media platforms such as blogs, forums, Facebook groups, Instagram and so on. Online presence can make for a huge success in business growth, as has been proven by those who have taken to blogs and Instagram and have ended up with thousands of followers, majority of which now consume their product.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong>:<br />
Facebook, Instragram, Linked In, Google searches, Tumblr and Twitter are the popluar online mediums that you can use to hangout where your target customers do. Determine which one best suits your product / service and where your customer hangs out. A good way to research which is the best media for you is to see what the leaders in your industry are doing, then use that as a starting point.</p>
<p>Hashtags are a great place to attract your target consumer. Make your hashtags specific and people from all aspects of the globe will be able to find you.</p>
<p>For example: A health coach will find themselves joining Facebook groups of people wanting to get healthy, local community hubs online, online forums about being healthy, and can hashtag their particular health products or specialities.</p>
<p>Figuring out where your people are can be a bit of trial and error, however it is much more efficient use of your time. A great approach is to interact either in person or virtually by adding value to their lives with no expectation in return. This allows for trust to develop within your target market and builds your expertise. When the time comes you will be the forefront of their mind to purchase from you or refer you.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your website is your virtual store front, and just as a store needs to change it’s window displays regularly and keep it modern and appealing so too does your website.</p>
<p>You set up business, you get a website and then you get busy running the business. But do you regularly look at your site and ensure it’s current? Technology and marketing trends are changing every couple of years, but have you kept your website and business up to date? Just as retailers test the effectiveness of displays and in-store offers, do you test your offers and analyse your website traffic and visitor behavior?</p>
<h3>What goes into making a website and homepage effective? Here are 10 questions to ask &nbsp;yourself to determine if it&#8217;s time for an update or an overhaul.</h3>
<h5>1. Is your website mobile-friendly?</h5>
<p>Is it responsive to the device it is being looked at on? Easy way to test this is use your phone and visit your site. Is it easy to read the text, does the navigation work? Can the whole site be seen in the screen? If you can’t it is not what is referred to as responsive. This is important as over 60% of Internet users use a handheld device.</p>
<h5>2. Is your homepage eye catching and appealing?</h5>
<p>The homepage is the most visited page on your site so it should be captivating and accurately represent your unique brand, and voice. You have on average 6 minutes to communicate what you offer, how and whom you help. You communicate this through the layout, branding, colours, typography, visuals and words. Does it look bland or amateurish? Who are you trying to attract and would your site appeal to them in its current form?</p>
<h5>3. Is the information prioritised on the homepage?</h5>
<p>This means that the headlines and sub-headlines need to be clear, and communicate what your business offers and how you can help prospective visitors. Are the features listed of your offering and the benefits of working with you clear and easy to find? The eye is drawn to the most prominent element on your pages, make it the headings that communicate to the prospective customer.</p>
<h5>4. Is navigation logical, easy to find?</h5>
<p>You don’t want to make people hunt as they will only leave your site. Use easy-to-understand language as Navigation titles, not obscure quirky titles. It might seem fun but your customer will get irritated and click away. If you have many pages on your site, try to group them logically and give them a ‘banner name’ to fall under and use that as the title on the navigation bar. Less is more.</p>
<h5>5. Prominent call-to-action visible on each page?</h5>
<p>A ‘call-to-action’ is what you want a visitor to act on, such as Contact you, Sign up for your newsletter, Request a free consultation or quote. If your website doesn’t include a call-to-action you are missing out on business. Majority of people need to be prompted or they will do nothing.</p>
<h5>6. Enticing Opt-in offer?</h5>
<p>An opt-in is a box that pops up while you are on a website. It includes a free offer to entice the visitor to hand over their email address. You get to increase your ‘list’ and the visitor gets some hopefully useful, inspiring information. Win-win. The opt-in is part of your sales funnel, your captured audience to sell your services to.</p>
<h5>7. Are you using video on your homepage to communicate your offerings?</h5>
<p>Recent changes to the Google algorithms means that video is the new ‘blog post’ in terms of helping your site rank better. Make sure they are well-thought out, and you look fresh and professional. Take time to consider your background and what the viewer will see. Make it tidy, interesting but not busy and if possible relatable to your offering. Some people use a backdrop of their branding colours, other their home lounge (organising or interior services).</p>
<h5>8. Are your testimonials prominently displayed or easy to find?</h5>
<p>Testimonials help your prospective customers get an insight into what you are like to work with, what kind of businesses you have worked with and which will influence their purchasing decisions. Check out my article on tips for getting great testimonials <a title="7 WAYS TO MAKE NETWORKING EASIER" href="https://confettidesign.com.au/7_ways_to_make_networking_easier/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h5>9. Are your social media icons visible and easy to find?</h5>
<p>Social media is useful to feed back into your sales funnel, which is your site. You can put your blog posts on social media, share to your hearts content but makes sure it’s relevant to your customer and drives them back to your site. Have your social media icons on every piece of content so visitors can share it also. The more people are talking about you, your content and your site the better.</p>
<h5>10. Has your site got an SEO plugin for keywords on each page and for each post?</h5>
<p>Are the keywords people use to look for you when they search you and your business service mentioned multiple times throughout your website?<br />
Each page must have a keyword for that page so that search engines can register it when people search. If you don’t the search engine will ‘skip’ past your site and you will never get found.</p>
<p>If you have answered yes to all 10&nbsp;then congrats you are doing well. If you said no to 4 or less then you need not only an updated website but may need some marketing help as well.</p>
