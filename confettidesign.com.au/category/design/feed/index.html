										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Our Bayside Website Designer Explains How to Design the best website for your business.</strong></h1>
<p>Designing a website can seem simple! We want a website to convert, to be a 24/7 sales tool for your business. However, there are core steps that are missed from the outset that decrease the conversion rates for websites when visitors land. In this post, we run through the 7 steps our Bayside website designer, Johannah Barton, uses with every new client’s website project to help convert visitor traffic and it will outline how to design the best website for your small business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The 7 steps on how to design the best website and to convert visitor website traffic are:-</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a project plan</li>
<li>Choose your website builder platform(content management system)</li>
<li>Determine your keywords for site optimisation</li>
<li>Homepage: decide on layout and menu navigation</li>
<li>What is your colour scheme and image tone</li>
<li>Create your content keeping in mind your keywords</li>
<li>Test, publish and update</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 &#8211; </strong><strong>Create a plan</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Get out a pen and paper and begin answering these 5 questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Who is your site for?</li>
</ol>
<p>Think about your future audience and your business goals. The more niche or specific you are about your target audience the easier it is to connect with them. What is important to them so you can speak to those barriers or dreams. Also if you wish to get found at all on Google and use your site as a tool you MUST consider search engine optimisation or SEO. More about this in step 3.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What are your services / product? What will your target market want to find on your homepage in order to know that you can help them?</li>
<li>What would you like your business brand to communicate via this website?</li>
<li>What action do you wish them to take as a result of landing on your site?</li>
<li>What kind of features do you need in your website? Does it need a checkout cart or private locked area for customers only?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your site should reflect the answers to these questions. For example, if your customer is older and more conservative in their outlook and values, then you will need a formal and professional site, using more subdued colours and images that convey trust, professionalism and maturity.</p>
<p>Going through this process ensures you design for your customer as well as your product and your tastes. Take some time to also investigate what your competitors are doing. Johannah will research her client’s industries locally and overseas to see what not to do. These are shared with clients to gauge what they like and don’t like to help narrow the design direction.</p>
<p>We must know where we wish to end up in order to build the path. Johannah always suggests her customers think about where they hope their business will be in 3 -5 years and design for that point.  Stretch yourself in terms of goals and target market so once you launch you begin to attract the type of business or customer you want more of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2 &#8211; </strong><strong>Choose your website builder platform.</strong></h3>
<p>One of the many reasons why you plan your website first is so you understand what features your small business website platform must be able to deliver.</p>
<p><strong>For example consider some of these features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>do you care if the platform shows their ads on the top and bottom of your website?</li>
<li>do you want to blog as a strategy to improve your Google ranks and traffic to your site?</li>
<li>do you care If you are stuck on their platform forever?</li>
<li>do you need to integrate with 3<sup>rd</sup>party applications or have an e-commerce facility?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The main options available are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>WordPress (by far our preferred platform that you can fully own as a business asset, customiseable, grows with you, unlimited features)</li>
<li>Squarespace (limited restrictions on 3<sup>rd</sup>party aps and forever on their platform, not easily customisable)</li>
<li>WIX (is cheap but you are stuck on their platform and limited by their features and the SEO is questionable)</li>
<li>Webbly (is cheap but you are stuck on their platform and limited by their features. Also charge you 3% on every purchase made if you have an ecommerce facility)</li>
<li>Go Daddy (limited functionality and customising, forever on their platform, not your business asset)</li>
<li>Custom made websites typically sit within the developers CMS, meaning you will be with your developer for the duration of the websites life</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 &#8211; </strong><strong>Determine your keywords for your small business website optimisation</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Hearing someone say SEO, search engine optimisation, keywords, google traffic can make your eyes roll back in your head! </strong></p>
<p>In a nutshell what we are saying at this point is <strong>On-page SEO,</strong> or &#8220;saying something to a search engine,&#8221;. Meaning optimising your individual website pages so that they rank higher on search engine results pages. It is one of the most important tasks while designing your site and will save you much time and confusion once your site is built if you focus on your small business website optimisation now.</p>
<p>Before you put your head under the doona and hide, think of it like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your customer searching for in Google in order to find your services? Put yourself in the shoes of your target audiences.</li>
<li>What types of topics would your target audience search that you&#8217;d want your business to get found for?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This practise is called keyword research<br />
</strong>Keyword research helps you come up with and narrow down a list of terms you should be including in your navigation, website copy and ultimately is what is site optimisation. You use the Keyword Planner tool that sits in the dashboard of a Google Adwords account. When you go to write your headlines and copy you can then include these phrases in the heading tags and content. These phrases can also help you when you are writing blogs once you go live with your website. The expression ‘content is king’ still rules because it is what will get your website ranking higher and moving upwards to position 1 for keyword phrases.</p>
<p><strong>Once the site is built<br />
</strong>Regardless of which platform you choose to build your website on you will also include these phrases into the SEO ad-on app. In WordPress the most widely used plugin is the Yoast SEO Plugin, it will show at the bottom of each page and you will want to complete the plugin for each allocated phrase you selected, for that page.  This is why it is important to do this now before you begin writing, even the URL&#8217;s need to be planned!</p>
<p>Refer to our blog <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/how-to-complete-the-yoast-seo-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> about completing the Yoast Plugin</p>
<p>This is a specialised service and you certainly can give it a whirl, but if you want to get the most out of your website once it goes live, and attract as much Google love as you can, talk to us about our SEO partners and our small business website search engine optimisation services.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 4 &#8211; </strong><strong>Homepage: decide on layout and menu navigation</strong></h3>
<p>Once you’ve picked your website-building platform, it’s time to focus on your navigation and layout. This is the first creative step of how to design the best website. An easy way to think of it is that your homepage is like your shop window, and you only get one opportunity to make a great first impression.</p>
<p>The best website for your business will inspire a visitor to take the action you set out as your goal in your plan. If you refer back to your plan you know that there is a target audience, a service or product they have come looking for and a type of provider that will trust or will suit them.</p>
<p>We’ll now cover two aspects of the homepage: the layout and menu navigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Homepage layout</strong></p>
<p>On a simple level, a homepage has two parts: above and below the fold. Above the fold is before you scroll down and below is what follows after the visitor has scrolled. Needless to say, you want all the core messaging above the fold so if the visitor doesn’t scroll they can answer the following three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do you do?</li>
<li>Can you help me?</li>
<li>How can you help me better than the other website I’ve just been to?</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, on the banner or as close to the top of the page when you land, should be one sentence summarising the value your site adds, to whom and a bold call to action, what you want them to do. You can also include your services and benefits of using you before the visitor has to scroll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Next let’s look at what goes below the fold or after you scroll.<br />
</strong>This can contain more in-depth content that provides details about you as the business, social proofing of testimonials or client logos, case studies or videos.</p>
<p>Keep the page concise and shorter rather than longer. This is substantiated by conversion analysis software such as Crazy Egg. The heat map, click analysis and recordings of visitors behaviour on sites shows them not going much further past one scroll after the fold. As such keep all the important information as close to the fold as possible.  Less is more applies. A way to deal with the extra, more in-depth content, can be to put that onto another page. This also offers you an opportunity to add more relevant keyword search phrases to your website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Homepage navigation </strong></p>
<p>The navigation bar is the menu visitors use to navigate your site.</p>
<p>The key to successful navigation is thinking like your customer and using the words that resonate with them and that explain what the page purpose is. For example, ‘shop large dog beds’ instead of ‘our products’. Don’t overload your visitors with too many options. This will lead to choice paralysis.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some guidelines for how to design the best website navigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only add necessary pages</li>
<li>Build categories of related pages all under a clear summary heading</li>
<li>Making sure page titles are short and clear</li>
<li>Ensure the navigation bar is easily visible</li>
<li>If there are lots of pages group the related pages together. For example have corporate information on one top navigation such as include links to Contact, About Us pages and an FAQ page and then product or service headings closer to the banner under the logo.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 5 &#8211; </strong><strong>Choose a color scheme to match your brand</strong></h3>
<p>Did you know that over 80% of online shoppers stated a key reason they buy a particular product was due to colour.(recent Kissmeteric <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/psych-101-for-your-website-the-color-factor-2011-7?IR=T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> .</p>
<p>Johannah at Confetti Design,  designs brands as well as websites so generally the brand will drive the website design. Both are designed with a core goal of communicating a message and appealing to a target audience. She explains that the colour you choose as your dominant website colour should keep these two things in mind.  In this step we’d like to help you come up with a winning color strategy for your site.</p>
<p><strong>A good color strategy involves three things:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A core colour combined it with a complimentary colour. An easy guide is if your core colour is strong chose a softer complimentary colour</li>
<li>A background colour</li>
<li>A consistent colour scheme across the site. This includes the colour palate of the images you select</li>
</ul>
<p>Now your core/dominant color should be the one you want people to remember. It will be the core colour of your logo. High-value parts of your site should be designed in your dominant color.</p>
<p>It is vital that before you launch into the website design you understand the meaning of colors.  Red, for example, evokes passion and urgency. It attracts impulsive shoppers and <em>can </em>be effective for fast food and clearance sales.  Learn what each color represents and make sure the one you choose reflects your brand and will evoke the right emotion from your customers.</p>
<p>When selecting a background colour, remember to keep this as light as possible. Think about why art gallery walls are generally white? They allow the focus to be kept on the art and in your case, not distracting from the core messaging, headlines and images.</p>
<p>Complimentary colors can be used across your site to jazz up key areas. Experiment with different colored outlines to make buttons and subtitles pop out.</p>
<p>Whatever color palette you choose, it’s very important to remain consistent.</p>
<p>Don’t have different color schemes on different pages. Your visitors will just get confused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 6 &#8211; </strong><strong>Create your content keeping in mind your customer and keywords</strong></h3>
<p>The content refers to all the words, images and fonts.  This is where the design magic happens so in this step, we’ll explain each starting with fonts.</p>
<p><strong>Font selection</strong></p>
<p>As a rule, keep it to a max of 2 fonts with a max of 2 thicknesses. The reason being is that we still want the visitor to be able to read the words and not be too distracted.</p>
<p>More importantly is keeping the fonts legible, so we are talking about cursive or script fonts. Use them for a design feature if it suits your brand but only for short words or 2-word statements for the design effect. There is no point using a ‘pretty’ font if no one can read it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Consistency Counts<br />
</strong>We talked about colour selection and keeping the usage to a few core colours and the same applies to fonts and font colours. Keep it consistent across pages, hence for all core headings use the same size font and thickness; paragraph font is always the same size and thickness.</p>
<p>You can be a bit more creative with the “call-to-action” (CTA) buttons but keep the language simple and font selection legible. Additionally, ensure the CTA button colour complements your website colour palate. It’s not just about the font, it’s also about the space between lines of text. The perfect line height is around 150% of the font size you’re using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Content<br />
</strong>There is an absolute art to writing for a website. Where possible we would advise you use a copywriter not only because they are experts but also to ensure the keywords extracted from the research in Step 3 are woven into your pages.</p>
<p>The content has to engage and speak to your audience and at the same time be succinct and eye-catching. There is nothing more likely to make a visitor bounce off your site than long sections of text, well perhaps putting long sections of white text on a dark or bright background! To make your content stand out, try surrounding it with white space and use headings to make core messages get noticed</p>
<p>Finally, make sure there are no sloppy spelling or grammar mistakes in your site’s copy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Images<br />
</strong>With less than 6 seconds to make an impression images are an easy way to connect with your visitor. Images are certainly one vital element in how to design the best website for your small business and they have the power to make your website unique and really stand out.</p>
<p>Visual content increases engagement and length of time on a site. Plus, images stick in the mind. If we hear a piece of information, we’ll only remember 10% of it; but if you add a picture, you’ll remember an incredible 65%, according to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy">one study</a>.  You can of course overdo it and more images will slow down your website so size them correctly, and of course name them correctly so Google crawls them. An un-named image will have Google stop crawling your website.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>In this post, I’ll go over Contact Us page best practices 2018, including the core purposes of your contact page and how you can improve your contact page.</h2>
<p>It is one of the most visited pages on your website and often the most overlooked page. When you think about it, really it should be the most considered page as it’s what you want people ultimately do right, contact you! Read on to find out what the contact us page best practices 2018 are then you can make some updates and monitor your improved conversions.</p>
<p>For many businessess, the contact page manages all incoming contact requests. Therefore you can help the user get the right information before they have to make an enquiry or guide the enquiry. This can be achieved by including popular FAQ’s or directions on how to find the business or the appropriate person in the company.</p>
<p>What works for others, might not work for your contact page. It highly depends on what kind of business you have.</p>
<h3>1. Essential elements of your contact page</h3>
<p>Think about what <em>you</em> look for when visiting a contact page. Personally, I like it when a company leaves a phone number, it shows me they are accessible. However I don’t always want to call so having a direct contact email address is a bonus. Personally I am not keen on contact forms, I have a feeling they get lost, however I do use them.</p>
<p>So I’d advise you provide everything: Contact page must-have details would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company name.</li>
<li>Company address &amp; map</li>
<li>General company phone number.</li>
<li>General company email address.</li>
<li>Contact form.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3>2. Check your grammar:</h3>
<p>There are generally not too many words on a Contact Us page so best we choose our words carefully and ensure grammar is perfecto!</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>3. Keep it simple but relevant:</h3>
<p>A contact us page can include other information for the visitor such as a map of your location, department head contacts or specific CTA’s for a demo or tour booking over a general enquiry. Whatever it is, ensure you make it easy to find the contact form and the contact details. Keep the design simple and font big and clearly legible, not silly script fonts! Another maddening trend is to make fields mandatory or fields not relevant to your target market.  A sure-fire way to miss out on the form being completed.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>4. Why and when should I contact you?</h3>
<p>It might sound obvious, but telling your visitors why and when they should or shouldn’t contact you is really helpful. One of the most successful things you can achieve via your website pages is managing expectations.  For example you can inform people how long they may have to wait to hear back from you. Or provide a few topics of what they can contact you about via a dropdown on the contact form.<br />
Or  you could simply let them know you only take calls before 4pm each day and you reply to every message within 8 hours.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>5. Look gorgeous:</h3>
<p>When users visit your contact us page, it is the beginning of a relationship so first impressions count. Include great visuals of the team or on-brand personality-plus images to help create a good connection. You want the visitor to be keen to contact you. A bland white page with a contact form is not overly enticing.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>6. Show off your personality:</h3>
<p>Users who visit your contact us page are there to reach out to you and learn more about you. Think about how you want your copy to reflect your brand persona. If your audience is the casual, fun-loving crowd, consider a light-hearted, even comical tone for your contact us page.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>7. Provide some FAQ’s:</h3>
<p>For a larger company or if you need to be mindful of your time offering a series of commonly asked questions is a great way to filter emails. It can save time and limit the number of un-necessary emails. The contact page is simply be a great place to put FAQ’s as logically people are there to reach out for something and perhaps that something is a question you can answer immediately.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>8. Add in a virtual chat function:</h3>
<p>Many sites now have the slide-in or pop-up virtual chat facility which can be annoying but your Contact Us page can be the perfect location for this.  In our online era, many users prefer chatting online with a help agent rather than calling in person. If this sounds like your demographic then why not provide a quick and easy way to get help. Below the chat window pop some FAQ&#8217;s and other means of contact, giving users their contact method of choice.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>9. Include a compelling call-to-action:</h3>
<p>This can simply be how you design and feature the core call-to-action, such as making your phone number a clickable bright coloured button. Make sure it’s clear what you want your visitor to do on that contact page, pick your preferred contact method and make it stand out.</p>
<p>In summary take a good look with new eyes at your contact page as most are dull and boring and when they show to be one of the top 3 pages visited. Give the audience what they need and hope to see and then a bit of a surprise too!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many small business owners when starting out get caught up in the pretty stuff, like a logo and a website. Don’t get me wrong this is my core business so I know they are important but what is key is what you want these ‘pretty’ things to communicate? This article will help to explain what is the difference between a logo and a brand.</p>
<p>We can all agree having a logo is a key element to effectively marketing your business – just look at Virgin or fashion houses like Chanel, but what many people don’t consider is the messages or emotions you want to evoke in a prospective customer before you start the designing process. The brand is what people feel about your business, the impression they are left with, the reputation is built into the brand personality not simply the logo.<br />
The reason you want to make this distinction is that you will be able to achieve results that make a difference to your bottom line by determining the message behind your brand. You&#8217;ve heard the phrase, &#8220;A picture says a thousand words.&#8221; This is so true of your branding. The first thing some of your customers will come in contact with regarding your company is your brand. This first impression will last forever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Brand is What People Say about You When you’re Not Around.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>When developing a new brand or reviewing how effective your existing brand is, there are some questions to ask yourself: </strong><br />
• What do we want to be known for?</p>
<ul>o Is it sophistication, quickness, strength, proven results, expert knowledge, easy of service, creativity</ul>
<p>• What core values underpin who we are as a company / business?</p>
<ul>o Integrity, honesty, care, approachable, fun</ul>
<p>• What emotions do we want to evoke in our prospective customer?<br />
o Trust, relief, satisfaction, commitment, excitement,</p>
<ul>• Who do we want to attract as a customer? (be specific and niche)</ul>
<p>o All single mothers of toddlers living anywhere in Australia who also work part-time and are committed to being strong and healthy but don’t have time to go to gym</p>
<ul>• Does our target market identify with your current brand? (Ask them in a survey)</ul>
<p><strong>How do these impact the design of a brand?</strong><br />
A businesses brand elements; colours, typography, visuals, logo, work together to identify and distinguish the brand in the consumers&#8217; mind. Your brand personality leaves an impression that either engages the consumer or doesn’t. What you aim for is a brand identity that communicates your unique voice and that voice speaks directly to YOUR customer. In order to know how to do this you must research and think about exactly HOW you want to be perceived and WHO you want to serve in your business then make sure these actually match, their worlds collide so-to-speak!</p>
<p>Thinking about your customer as well as what is unique about your service will help your designer determine the following; </p>
<ul>o the type images to use in the website, insta feed or marketing collateral</ul>
<ul>o the colours and colour intensity used in your brand</ul>
<ul>o the font selection</ul>
<ul>o the scale of the logo</ul>
<ul>o elements used in creating a logo such as lines, repetition, organic shapes versus geometric</ul>
<p>All these elements will help to create the perfect brand persona for your business that also attracts that perfect customer. We would also highly recommend you consider how you present yourself in person. As an extension of your brand are you presenting a consistent first impression? Reach out to as stylist to get some advice on this. </p>
<p>One incredible unexpected outcome about doing all this &#8216;thinking or strategy&#8217; work is that it makes further decisions very easy to make, giving you a feeling of confidence, freedom and a sense of ease.<br />
To explain, if all this ground working thinking and decisions are made about you, target market means the following is pretty easy:</p>
<ul>o what style of photography is needed</p>
<ul>o packaging or products or your &#8216;un-boxing&#8217; experience</p>
<ul>o what type of content is important to attract your customer and gain social traction</p>
<ul>o where to network</p>
<ul>o where to advertise</p>
<ul>o what to support </p>
<ul>o which physical groups to join or Facebook groups or if this is where your customer is at all</p>
<ul>o what to say at your networking events to describe your business </p>
<p>Essentially with all the foundations of values and target market secured you are free to position yourself and market without stress and indecision. </p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve tried your best to create your own website; you have labored for hours over the words to capture your visitor&#8217;s interest, you have added some pretty images. You are also getting good traffic to your website, but you wonder why most of these leads don’t convert and they leave after only a few seconds of visiting a page on your site. You will be rubbing your head asking why aren&#8217;t visitors staying on my website?</p>
<p>According to the Nielsen Norman Group, (leaders in user experience research) most users stick around less than 59 seconds. This means that if you are unable to capture your user’s attention in less than a minute, you’ve lost them. Frightening when you think of the effort already put into your small business website!</p>
<p>I’ve pulled together a few reasons why your visitors don’t stay on your website for long and what you might do to rectify the situation. Keep in mind with marketing, there is no absolute definative answer, it is a task of test and measure. Try addressing a few of these issues below then monitor the changes to behaviour in your analytics dashboard. (Just on this: if you don&#8217;t have analytics please do that first, you have invested in a website, respect that expenditure by monitoring what happens on it, who comes to it, where they come from)</p>
<p>You don’t need to do all of the suggestions below at once. And it goes without saying try the cheapest and quickest ideas first, test it out, observe results then try another idea.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your website design is not engaging or talking ‘to’ your customer</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The truth is we all judge the book by its cover, you are naive to think otherwise and losing opportunities. Design matters and clarity of message is important. Appealing to your customer is vital, if you can look at your site through their eyes is a good start.</p>
<p>If your site still looks like a design of 1992, or it’s not responding on a table or phone, then you actually do need to invest the dollars in a professional makeover design. If your site is responsive but not sure if it’s the design that is outdated or how to fix it, take advantage of a website and brand review. There are quite a few automated ones online and we also offer the service <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/website-audit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEBSITE AUDIT</a>.<br />
Benefit of a review is you get the perspective of a visitor, then you can try to fix the issues yourself before starting a complete re-design.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Your website content is difficult to read</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your design is not only about your choice of colors, graphics or images, but the colors of your text and background determine how easy your visitors can read and digest the content on your website. The simple truth is your website won’t convert well if it can’t be easily read. There are no particular fonts to use and which to avoid, however when in doubt use one font in 2 -3 sizes or thickness on light backgrounds. The next big tip is to break up all sections of copy with a hierarchy of really important summary headings, a secondary sub-heading then the body of the copy. This breaks the information into bit sized pieces for the visitor.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Your customer can’t find what they want quick enough on your website</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This could be because you are trying to get them to act to too many calls-to-action or they can’t find anything clear to act on. You can fix this easily.</p>
<ol>
<li> the navigation might be using silly names to describe pages so it’s not clear where to go – change to simple descriptions</li>
<li> you have no clear and highly visible buttons or offerings that ask the visitor to do anything. This could be CALL US, BOOK A FREE QUOTE, DOWNLOAD OUR AWESOME GUIDE, VIEW ALL SERVICES.</li>
<li> keep language simple. Using convoluted language to appear intelligent firstly comes off annoying and secondly the visitor still can’t find what you do, how you help them and what they should do next</li>
<li> no clear services within the top section of the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>The core learning here is to keep the language simple, spell out what you do, how you do it and who you help in as few words as possible. Finally include one call to action you wish the visitor to take.</p>
<p>E.g Heading: We offer Osteopathy to reduce muscle pain in sports people, elderly, pregnancy and children.<br />
Followed by a button: MAKE A BOOKING</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>The videos on your website auto-play</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There is nothing that will make your visitor leave your business website within seconds of arriving than a video that auto-plays. Today’s digital-savvy customers now prefer to be the boss; they like to choose when they wish to consume online content. A quick way to get users off your site is by blasting unwanted content at them without their consent. A follow up to this is to keep your videos to less than 2 minutes, get to the point and keep the focus on who you help, how and why with as little about you as possible. Keep the old marketing adage ‘what’s in it for me’ at the forefront.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong video is a huge strategy to keep people on your site. Video will also help develop a connection with your visitor quicker than words, keep it short, show your personality and focus on solving their problems. Video testimonials are also extremely powerful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Add your customer testimonials for credibility</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>63% of customers will more likely to purchase from a site with reviews. (see full report <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/9366-ecommerce-consumer-reviews-why-you-need-them-and-how-to-use-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here )</a><br />
Use testimonials for social proof, overcoming barriers to purchase, shows real experience of working with you. Testimonials have bonus benefits as search engine spiders like fresh new content and a review is a great and easy way to fee the spiders. If you would like a testimonial template to get incredible praise for your work from customers try ours <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/testimonial-template-freebie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, it&#8217;s FREE!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, there we have 5 tips to help you keep your visitors on your site and converting more of them.  The good news is that you are getting traffic so high five for that, but now is the time to see how you can improve conversions and hopefully we &#8216;ve given you a couple of fixes to answer your question why aren&#8217;t people staying on my website that you can enact yourself.</p>
