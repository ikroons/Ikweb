<h2><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-14688 aligncenter" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot-1024x831.png" alt="" width="1024" height="831" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot-1024x831.png 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot-300x243.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot-768x623.png 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot.png 1345w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />When does the application close?</h2>
<p>The rebate applications will be available from the 1<sup>st</sup> December 2020 to 31<sup>st</sup> March 2021, or until the funds for the program are exhausted. If success, Confetti Design hopes the Victorian Government continues this digital initiative to help small businesses with their websites and e-commerce stores including Shopify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How quickly will I receive the rebate?</h2>
<p>As a small business, you will be contacted by the Victorian Government within six weeks to ensure you have started to use your selected digital product and payment. Once the Government has confirmation of the continued use of the digital product, you will receive the $1,200 rebate within 10 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Is my small business eligible?</h2>
<p>To be eligible for the rebate, your business will need to be located in Victoria and held an ABN since 13<sup>th</sup> September 2019. You will also need to be registered for GST on the 13<sup>th</sup> September 2020.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-14689 aligncenter" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot-1024x831.png" alt="" width="1024" height="831" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot-1024x831.png 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot-300x243.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot-768x623.png 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot.png 1345w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />What if I already use one of the digital products?</h2>
<p>To be eligible for the program, you need to ensure the digital product is a new adaption and is not currently being used by the business. The great news is that the eligibility includes upgrading an existing product with additional features that provide greater digital capability. If you have used one of the products such as Shopify in the past, which is more than a year ago, and resume the adoption of the digital product you will also be eligible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What doesn’t the program cover?</h2>
<p>The program does not cover renewals of existing digital products provided as part of the program. It also does not include minor updates to existing products. Most importantly, the digital product, such as Shopify, must be available under the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How will I know how to use the digital products available under the <em>Small Business Digital Adaption Program </em>?</h2>
<p>Once you are registered under the program, free training and workshops are available and training dates are available in the training calendar that is published on the <a href="https://www.business.vic.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Victoria</a> website. The training and workshops are run across Melbourne metropolitan area and also in regional Victoria. The great news is if you are currently using one of the available products you can also attend the workshop and training days.</p>

			<h6>Learning management systems (LMS) are software platforms that enable businesses to build and deliver educational courses. Many consumers are looking to increase their skill set and knowledge by completing online training programs, rather than physically attending schools. An LMS delivers content, which can include knowledge documents, videos, courses and quizzes. The team at Confetti Design has delivered several projects using the learning management system <em>Access Ally</em>, and we thought it was worthwhile to review and detail this LMS.</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is <em>Access Alley</em>?</h2>
<p>Many LMS are not a stand-alone system and are plugins for websites such as WordPress. <em>Access Ally</em> is a complete plugin for WordPress that enables small business to build an  online learning business within their WordPress small business website. <em>Access Ally </em>focuses on deep CRM integration, and simplifies the process to add tests, progress the tracking of course completion, video links or anything else you would like to offer on your course pages. <em>Access Ally</em>  supports the upload of student work. The key selling point for <em>Access Ally</em> is its integration with your existing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How did <em>Access Ally</em> start?</h2>
<p><em>Access Ally </em>began as way to manage access to online courses and quickly developed into a full service membership plugin. <em>Access Ally </em>has WordPress-themed order forms that allows users to offer one-time payments, subscriptions. It is enhanced with individually triggered time-sensitive coupons, including trial offers, and 1-click upsells to your customers. <em>Access Ally </em>enables members to manage their credit cards that are on file and their subscriptions from within Access Ally.</p>
<h2><em>Access Ally</em> Pricing – A Simple Offer</h2>
<p><em>Access Ally </em> has a transparent pricing offer ,where subscribers pay one flat fee, regardless of the number of courses, memberships, or members a small business will have. Even better, <em>Access Ally </em>does not take commissions on any of your online course sales, and integrates with Stripe and PayPal straight out of the box.</p>
<h2>Why <em>Access Ally </em>over other Learning Management Systems</h2>
<p><em>Access Ally </em>prides its on being the one tool that simply handles everything<em> &#8211;</em> from accepting payments, the ability to create courses, easy integrations with online tools such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Active Campaign</li>
<li>Convert Kit</li>
<li>Drip</li>
<li>Infusionsoft</li>
<li>Keap</li>
<li>Ontraport, and of course CRM’s.</li>
</ol>
<p>It offers the best member management of any LMS on the market. There is effortless integration of <em>Access Ally’s</em> learning management system (LMS) with your existing CRM. Small business will not need to pay for and integrate additional plugins to handle payments and payment administration, membership levels to run cohesive membership sites, and integration with your CRM for marketing automation. Some of the course features include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant and dripped courses</li>
<li>Team accounts</li>
<li>Progress tracking of courses</li>
<li>Homework submissions</li>
<li>Video view tracking and bookmarks</li>
<li>Quizzes and Certificates</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Access Ally</em> Functionality – the Course Creation Wizard</strong></p>
<p>The team at Confetti Design found the ease of use and functionality of <em>Access Ally&#8217;s Course Creation Wizard</em> a great selling point for this LMS as it creates courses as a WordPress page. Small business can easily keep their content, or import it into another LMS product later. When evaluating LMS’s for our small business website customers, we found many business lose access to their content if they decide to cancel their LMS subscription, which is not the case with <em>Access Ally</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Access Ally </em>enables small business to select your LMS compatible “WordPress theme” for functionality, speed, design flexibility, and features. There is no requirement for someone who can code in CSS to make the design, such as buttons and breadcrumbs, look and feel modern. It’s all in <em>Access Ally</em>!</p>
<p><strong><em><br />

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13629" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-IG-Sign-Up.png" alt="Confetti-Design-IG-Sign-Up" width="781" height="437" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-IG-Sign-Up.png 781w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-IG-Sign-Up-300x168.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Confetti-Design-IG-Sign-Up-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Instagram Profile Optimisation</strong></h2>
<p>It is essential that your IG profile is fully optimised as this helps your brand attract attention organically.</p>
<p>There is no “right” way to craft your profile, these principles are a solid starting point based on<br />
Instagram’s best practices.</p>
<p>There are just a few things to consider to make your profile simple yet optimised.</p>
<ul>
<li>Profile photo: It’s best to use your company logo as your profile photo so people can easily<br />
identify your brand.</li>
<li>Account name: Make this your business name, identical to your brand’s other social profiles.</li>
<li>Username: This should also be your business name. Note that your username cannot have any spaces. You may find your ideal name is taken so a good alternative is to add the city to the end of your username.</li>
<li>Website: This is your website URL. It is the only clickable URL on your Instagram page.  Most businesses either use their website or link to their latest promotional page. Ideally it should be a trackable url so you can measure effectiveness of you campaigns and posts with calls to action.</li>
</ul>
<p>TIP – a clever tool to sign up for so you can have multiple links is <a href="https://linktr.ee">https://linktr.ee</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Bio: Your bio is where you will capture the attention of other users. You can either describe what your business does, hype up your website or slap your brand’s slogan here (or all of the above, actually).</li>
<li>Link your business Facebook page: Instagram will ask you to link your business Facebook page or create one. For those unaware, Facebook acquired Instagram a few years ago so there is more integration than ever with the two platforms. This makes sharing direct from Instagram to Facebook easy, it can do it automatically.</li>
</ul>

			<p><strong>Stories</strong><br />
Instagram Stories is a feature that lets you post photos and videos that vanish after 24 hours.<br />
Instagram Stories appear in a bar at the top of your feed — and all Instagram accounts can share stories.</p>
<p>When there’s something new to see, their profile photo will have a colorful ring around it.<br />
To view someone’s story, you simply need to tap on their profile photo, and their story will appear fullscreen, showing you all of the content they’ve posted in the last 24hrs, the content will play in chronological order from oldest to newest.</p>
<p>Once you’re viewing a story, you can tap to go back and forward or swipe to jump to another person’s story. Unlike regular posts, there are no likes or public comments.</p>
<p>This is an advanced Instagram user tool but we are mentioning it here in the profile set up because of what you can do with stories. Normally stories disappear after 24 hours.</p>
<p>One of the best things about stories is you can save them them as highlights in your profile. It is another way to bulk out your profile and add categories or added value to your customer..such as products, client stories, staff behind the scenes. It allows you to connect more with your audience and build out your following. Look at the page below to understand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Instagram Stories views: How to check who’s seen your story</strong></p>
<p>Once your story is posted you can also view some basic analytics, to show you how many times each post in your story has been viewed and who has viewed it. When watching your own story, swipe up to check out this data and who’s seen each photo and video.</p>
<p><strong>How do I add a story to my Story Highlights?</strong></p>
<p>You can add stories to appear on your profile as highlights, even after they disappear. Highlights appear below your profile photo.</p>
<p>To add a story to a highlight:<br />
1. Go to your profile and tap Story Highights below your username and bio.<br />
2. Tap &#8220;+&#8221;<br />
3. Tap to select the story or stories you want to add to highlights, then tap Next.<br />
4. Choose a cover photo and enter a story name for your highlight, then tap Add (iPhone)<br />
or Done(Android). You can add more photos or videos to your highlight at any time by<br />
tapping Edit Highlight.</p>
<p>Note: Stories you add as highlights remain visible as highlights until you remove them, even after the original story has disappeared. Keep in mind that those you&#8217;ve allowed to see your story can also see your highlights.</p>
<p><strong>Branding hashtag:</strong><br />
Hashtags essentially act as a search function for Instagram to find relevant brands or products,<br />
information and people to follow. It rings true for users and businesses alike. And again, tapping into your target audience means getting specific so they can find you and your account comes up in user searches.</p>
<p>If you refer to your customer avatar answers you can consider what hashtags your customer might look for when getting inspiration. However if we were to look at generic hashtags pertaining to your business, there will be literally millions of posts.. you aren’t in all honesty going to get found using that. Rather than tackle the crowded hashtags, consider smaller more niche hashtags such as product based hashtags or location based ones. Also know what is trending for your customers.</p>
<p>The hard part is completed now for the fun part, creating your content plan and content.<br />
Read part 3 of our Instagram series to learn how to plan and design a feed that achieves your goals, engages your target audience and is the envy of your industry!</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have your pick of social media platforms, but for retailers the most successful and popular at the moment is Instagram. In the US 71% of businesses are on Instagram, there is no denying it is the place to be, and the visual nature of Instagram makes it likely to be the leader for a while to come.<br />
If you are not on Instagram then read up on our easy to follow steps so you start the right way. If you are already a gun on ‘the gram’ then these tips will be a good checklist to make sure you stay at the top of your game!<br />
This guide will take you through the 4 steps to starting in Instagram the right way that will make both the returns for your efforts and the on-going management so much easier.<br />
</span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 – Understanding your customer</strong></h3>
<p>Before you even think of creating the account, you want to get crystal clear on who your jewelry customer is. Truly understanding your target market is one of the most crucial things in running a successful business. It is only by having a clear idea in your mind of who you would like to reach, sell to or help that you can tailor and target your messages to have the strongest impact on your audience.</p>
<p>This has to be the key step that underpins your future success on Instagram. And really any marketing activity. Without it all your posting is like a scatter gun approach and the likelihood of connecting with your audience is slim.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you need to know your customer so clearly?</strong></p>
<p>1. You can create content to engage and connect with them when you have them in the forefront of your mind.<br />
2. You can ask yourself ‘will our perfect customer relate to this, be inspired to act, feel an emotional connection, be moved, feel like we ‘get them?’<br />
3. If you wish to use influencers, knowing who your customer is ensures you pick the right influencer.<br />
4. Engaging in cross promotions is easier as you look for other businesses who share the same customer.<br />
5. Although not a direct impact on your Instagram activity, knowing WHERE your customer hangs out or what they do in their life can guide your traditional marketing efforts. Local cafes to be linked with, event venues, magazines to advertise in. When you know where your customer spends their life means you can position yourself literally in their sight!</p>
<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>
<p>• What are your customer’s values? What is important to them?<br />
• What is their lifestyle? Or how do they spend their time? What is important to them?<br />
• What is their age?<br />
• Where do they live?<br />
• Is there a specific gender you serve more than another? – Who is really doing the research on your product?<br />
• What brands do they love?<br />
• Where do they eat, holiday, shop regularly?<br />
• What are their aspirations?<br />
• What magazines do they read, films watch, Netflix shows?</p>
<p><strong>The Problems</strong></p>
<p>• List all the problems you solve for your customers?<br />
• What emotions do they feel at the exact moment they discover your store and service?<br />
• What specific words and phrases are they saying to themselves or using to friends when describing how it feels to discover your service?</p>
<p><strong>The Solutions</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter whether you could realistically deliver or create these experiences, the goal is simply to unlock your imagination and challenge yourself to step into your customer’s shoes and see things in a new way. These insights will help with the type of content you create and how you try to engage your customers via Instagram.<br />
Before they found you what was their reality as it relates to buying a product like yours?<br />
• How were they trying to solve the problem?<br />
• Where were they looking to find a solution?<br />
• Who were they talking to in order to find a solution?<br />
• How was it impacting their personal life?<br />
• Have they tried other solutions before?<br />
• Why did that solution not work for them? Why are they still looking?<br />
• What do they wish Jewelers understood about them?<br />
• What is your customer’s dream? In their ideal world, what’s their ultimate fantasy of how your product or service would be delivered?<br />
• Do they have barriers to purchase from you?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions help build out a real picture of your target audience/s. Now you have this ‘persona’ or ‘ideal customer’ described it’s useful to even go to the extent of naming them, find images from magazines to visualize the perfect customers. It may be that you base this avatar on one of your best customers. In fact you could go to your most loyal customer and ask them to help answer the questions.</p>
<p>You not only have an amazing understanding of who you need to connect with via your posts, you also have a huge amount of content right in those answers. To see how we use all this fantastic insights be sure to download the guide called Instagram – Creating Content That Engages.<br />
Now we move onto the goal setting step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Set Your Goals</strong></h3>
<p>Now you have a good idea of who you want to become your brand follower, come into your store or click through to your website, you want to get your goals clear. The reason we do this is that having a clear goal or 2 or 3 goals allows you to purposefully create content and more chance of achieving the set goals.</p>
<p>Haphazardly posting is not a viable strategy when it comes to Instagram for business. Once you define who is your customer you need to define what it is your brand wants to do, then you can begin to better speak the language of your followers.</p>
<p><strong>How to Create a Social Media Goal</strong></p>
<p>Use the oldie-but-goodie SMART technique to set your goals.</p>
<p>S- <strong>Specific </strong></p>
<p>Goals should be clear and simple, but very detailed in terms of what you want to happen.</p>
<p>NOT SPECIFIC &#8211; increase our followers<br />
SPECIFIC &#8211; increase our followers by 100% by end of month August 2019</p>
<p>M- <strong>Measurable </strong></p>
<p>You will need to have a goal that you can measure, and there are a lot of social media tools that can help you measure the success of your strategy such as Instagram Insights. Ensure your website has analytics so you can track the number of new users that come from your Instagram account to specific product pages.</p>
<p>You can use a tool like Bitly.com that is a unique trackable url you can put into your bio.<br />
If you would like more reading on this..here is an article that lists 8 Instagram Analytics Tools <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/instagram-analytics-tools/">https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/instagram-analytics-tools/</a></p>
<p>A- <strong>Action Oriented </strong></p>
<p>This part is where you’ll create actionable task that will turn your goal into reality. Your “plan of attack will be detailed here as you create your goal.</p>
<p>An example of a goal is to increase the traffic to your store or online store that results in 20 new sales directly via your Instagram account in the month of August. This goal could include the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post offers that are redeemed in store or online</li>
<li>Post blogs</li>
<li>Post new products</li>
<li>Linked In-store activities – launch of a new product or a joint wedding dress fashion show with local bridal boutique in your store</li>
<li>Post snippet of a video with full length video on the website</li>
</ul>
<p>R- <strong>Realistic </strong></p>
<p>With all your resources on hand (time, money, people), is the goal you’re setting realistic? This is what you need to keep in mind when creating your goal. This is where you may reduce your goal or look to outsource some tasks to achieve the goals.</p>
<p>T- <strong>Time Bound </strong></p>
<p>Every goal needs a deadline, otherwise it’s not a goal—it’s a wishful thinking. Keeping in mind the complexity of the actions, as well as your resources, create a time frame that is both suitable to the goal as well as realistic.</p>

			<p><strong>You can create just a few goals to avoid being overwhelmed. Some of the most common Social Media goals are: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased brand awareness</li>
<li>Drive sales through traffic to your website</li>
<li>Drive sales through traffic to your store</li>
<li>Demonstrate company culture</li>
<li>Showcase your team and recruit new talent</li>
<li>Increase customer engagement and loyalty</li>
<li>Showcase products</li>
<li>Share company or industry news</li>
<li>Build a more engaged community</li>
<li>Connect with influencers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An example in action </strong></p>
<p>Let’s look at an example of a SMART goal for Increase Brand Awareness in the next 2 months:</p>
<p><strong>Specific- </strong>Build up brand awareness of the new website within two-month period</p>
<p><strong>Measurable- </strong>Reach 1,000 traffic increase in the next month and another 1,000 the following month.</p>
<p><strong>Action Oriented &#8211; </strong>Create pre-launch content to be posted to build momentum. Encourage pre-launch sign up for a discount or advanced warning of specials. During the first week of a product launch, create a post every 2 days with calls to action to the new website, sharing reviews, new product, video’s of users with product, unboxing experiences or blog posts on related topics to the launch and product. This can include paid sponsored ads</p>
<p><strong>Realistic &#8211; </strong></p>
<p>✓ Ads Budget : 8 week period x 2.5 posts a week x $10 = $200</p>
<p>✓ Content writer and graphic designer hired to create materials</p>
<p><strong>Time Bound- </strong>2 month period with check point of 1 month</p>
<p><strong>Set Your Baseline </strong></p>
<p>It is important that before you take any actions in your social media account against this goal that you have set your starting point. This means that you have the data from an analytics point of view on where you’re currently at (traffic to your site, bounce rates, particular page visits.) so that you’ll know exactly how your statistics are improving after implementing your actions.</p>
<p><strong>Check Points </strong></p>
<p>Lastly, set up check points to review your statistics so that you’ll see which is working or not. Is the ad budget boosting enough or reaching your preferred audience? Or is brand awareness really what you should focus on? You can check the social media and google analytics that you’ve set to gauge and evaluate your efforts.</p>
<p>Now you have a goal or set of goals you need a clear strategy to achieve these. However before we embark on that we need to do the one thing that makes all of our efforts easier, understanding our customer.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Now you have a clear vision of the customer to attract and a goal or set of goals your next step is to create a social media strategy. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Let’s recap </strong>– Goal #1 &#8211; Increase Brand Awareness in next 2 months</p>
<p>It is tricky to translate your social media efforts into sales especially when you’re in a brick and mortar business. However not including a social media strategy is effectively ignoring a huge portion of the potential customers.</p>
<p>Common metrics that can be measured are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of followers</li>
<li>Number of clicks through to the website from Instagram</li>
<li>Number of sales using unique Instagram promo code</li>
<li>Number of tags on other pages</li>
<li>Number of check ins</li>
<li>Number of comments</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instagram strategies to achieve this goal could be: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build content themes to speak to a problem of target audience</li>
<li>Share products your customer loves more than any others</li>
<li>Create articles that are indirectly related to your product but your customer would find helpful. Link these articles to your website, include the products on the blogs as an indirect selling opportunity</li>
<li>Share reviews that overcome barriers your customers have</li>
<li>Run a competition for free tickets to an event your customer would love to go to in your local area. One of the great benefits of having a location centric business is your customer is near you</li>
<li>Include your customers in video or in user generated content</li>
<li>Offer rewards for customers who share an unboxing image or video tagging you</li>
<li>Implement Instagram shopping on your website and linked to your account</li>
<li>Engage an influencer who shares your customer</li>
<li>Share other Instagram pages and content that your customer audience also follows to broaden your reach</li>
<li>Always reply or like any comments</li>
<li>Uncover niche hashtags that your customer is also following. Similarly, location-specific hashtags are perfect for zeroing in on an audience in your own neighborhood.</li>
<li>Consider the time of day to share when you know your audience is on the platform. Set up a schedule for posting so you are also not on it 24/7!</li>
<li>Tell stories to captivate your audience, the narrative of your brand is just as important as your customer in your content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list can go on.. but you have a comprehensive guide now of how to get started right, even before you set your account. The next guide will cover setting up your account and then the final in the series is about creating the content with purpose to achieve your goals.</p>

			<p>McKinsey is a global management consulting firm and provides lots of research about business practice.<br />
They recently wrote an article called “Building an e-commerce business: The lessons on moving fast”.</p>
<p>With consumers moving online in reaction to coronavirus restrictions, companies will need to learn how to launch new e-commerce businesses and quickly. Although the article focuses on large corporates, the team at Confetti Design think there are plenty of lessons that small businesses can learn from the McKinsey article.</p>
<p>As the full implications of COVID-19 are still unknown, there is emerging evidence that  points to a significant shift from retail “bricks-and-mortar” to e-commerce and online selling, as customers find shops closed and are limited in their ability to leave the house. This is backed by data that shows e-commerce jumped from 15 to 20% in China and a whopping 81% in Italy. These dramatic growth stats are just for February to March this year!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How long does it take to create an ecommerce capability? We disagree with McKinsey!</strong></h2>
<p>We agree with McKinsey that businesses can create a working e-commerce site in much less time than they think. In their estimation an e-commerce site can be running in less than 4 months. Our experience with building small business e-commerce sites however is it can be far speedier, with many sites being developed in less than a month. In fact, we have examples of our small business e-commerce websites being up and running in less than two weeks – if product, pricing, content and images are ready to go.</p>
<p>We recently worked with <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/website-portfolio/purely-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Purely Christmas</a>, who are passionate about applying an aesthetic sensibility to Christmas decorations. The Founder of the business had spent 15 years in retail and had a great understanding of what she wanted to offer. Confetti Design was able to launch the website within four weeks, working closely with the Founder who was hands-on with product description and uploading products to meet a tight deadline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before work starts on launching an e-commerce presence, small business owners need to be practical and logical. In some cases, rather than attempting to launch a full-blown digital business across all markets at once, a strategy would be to go to market fast with a narrow offering and in limited localities. This will help to gain strong traction and then scale up and out aggressively. This ‘tight offering’ strategy is supported by current supply chain challenges. There is nothing worse than being enticed by a product or service only to find the items is ‘out of stock’ online. I have personally experienced this multiple times in past weeks.</p>
<p>Our customer, <a href="https://boatshed7.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boastshed 7</a> source premium beach gear, accessories and skincare that is carefully curated from around the globe. Boatshed 7 started their e-commerce website with a smaller product offering, rather than the large range of beach products they had on offer. This enabled their marketing team to learn as they sold beach products and to offer a more tailored product that was targeted to a specific type of customer. As small businesses learn more about their customer, they can add more products to the product offering thus adding value to existing customers and broadening your reach to new customers. This is what Boatshed 7 did!</p>

			<h3><strong>Marketing ecommerce websites</strong></h3>
<p>Marketing is the key element of e-commerce websites. An understanding of the customer decision journey from complete lack of awareness to the moment a customer landed on the home page for the first time is of the utmost importance. We would suggest you begin your marketing effort well before launch, up to nine weeks before the launch, but considering the climate we are in you want to think creatively about this part of the prep work.</p>
<p>Just a few ideas are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Consider who has the same customer as you and would they share your offering to their database?</li>
<li>Create content to share on multiple platforms that solve your ideal customers problems as it relates to your products, linking back to your website
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>How to docs</li>
<li>Lists of resources</li>
<li>Opinion pieces</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Lists of articles</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a sign-up offer to bring people onto your email list with the intention to not sell immediately but nurture them to eventually become purchasers</li>
<li>During COVID-19 consider your customer and what is important to them. As you prepare your offer or terms perhaps you offer a portion of proceeds to assist someone or something that is in alignment with your customer values</li>
<li>Drive as much traffic as you can to your site either engaging in organic SEO either yourself or from an agency driven strategy, ADwords campaigns, re-marketing or Google shopping to build your authority and also potential email lists as well as customers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><br />
Measure!!!</strong></h3>
<p>We absolutely agree with McKinsey on this one.<br />
One of the great benefits with e-commerce websites is the ability to measure traffic and conversion in real-time with tools like Google Analytics. You can set up goals for tracking giving you real insights into how effective your website is performing. It allows you to track the progress that matters so that you can learn, adapt, and drive continual improvement. It is not enough to measure overall conversion or conversion by channel. Instead, small businesses need more granular metrics, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>identify relevant customer groups</li>
<li>measure micro-conversions per group</li>
<li>then improve continually – make changes to the shopping experience to increase website conversion</li>
<li>what is the current path to a goal ?</li>
<li>how many steps it takes to get to a goal?</li>
<li>where are you losing visitors?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of our customers, <a href="/website-portfolio/my-lollies/">MyLollies</a>, offers a large range of sweets and confectionary. The team at MyLollies are active Google Analytics users, who regularly monitor and make changes to their product placement and offers in order to successfully increase conversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main message here is that the launch of an e-commerce website is not a separate project, but much more an ongoing program of continual improvement which will bring success.</p>
<h3><strong><br />
Product and service offering tweaking</strong></h3>
<p>Not all ideas will work and sell well online. McKinsey gave an example of staff-curated bundles of products that were based on common occasions, such as birthdays. This tested really well with customers in pre-launch, but simply didn’t perform well in reality. Small businesses need to be prepared to cut product bundles or special offers if they are not working.</p>
<p>By keeping to a weekly review schedule, you can pivot away from poor ideas and generate new ones constantly until you find ones that work. Every week the improvements and lessons accumulate, and by month three, the e-commerce business has matured into a state at which a good sales day isn’t a victory but business as usual.</p>
<p>Building an e-commerce presence from scratch is no small undertaking for business. It was great to read and confirm our experience that a clear plan that is properly structured, can not only deliver an e-commerce website, but do it far faster than you might think is possible.</p>

			<p>Small businesses are looking for ways to implement new business models ahead of complete lockdown. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has tipped every Australian small business into unknown territory where continuing to exist has become a daily challenge.</p>
<p>The decisions taken by our State and Federal Governments to flatten the curve as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads around the world have been particularly rough on small business owners who have been told to shut their doors. This includes hospitality businesses, entertainment and major sports events, sports, play centres, swimming pools, gyms and fitness classes. It also extends to beauty therapy, tanning, massage and tattoo parlour operators.</p>
<p>The lifeline to many small businesses will be working out how to pivot to generate income. For those that don’t have an online shop, transition to an online offering quickly will help you keep your revenue going. Read <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/helpful-ecommerce-related-articles-from-confetti-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> how to go about this.</p>
<p>Here are some great examples of what businesses have done to continue to trade:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Food service industry</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-13489 aligncenter" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog.jpg" alt="Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog" width="1099" height="630" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog.jpg 1099w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-300x172.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-768x440.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1099px) 100vw, 1099px" /></p>
<p>Many restaurants and café’s that have had to close down the dine-in option but added their menu to Uber Eats to keep trading.  Uber Eats does take 30% of your revenue so having the ordering functionality through your website will earn you more. They have however agreed, due to public pressure, for restaurants to receive daily payments rather than once a week during the pandemic, and will scrap service fees on pick-up orders until 30 June.</p>
<p>Some business who have done this are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Attica </strong>&#8211; Beautiful meals delivered and wine selected by the head Somillier<br />
<a href="https://www.attica.com.au/delivery">https://www.attica.com.au/delivery</a></li>
<li>Wineries and cellar doors are begin to offer live wine tastings. <strong>WA Printhie Wines,</strong> Wine maker, Ed Swift view is &#8220;You can&#8217;t expect to keep operating in the same manner at a time like this, so we want to transfer our face-to-face cellar door experience to a safe online experience.”</li>
<li><strong>Relish Mama</strong> – Known in Bayside for the amazing cooking classes Nellie Kerrison has been running for years has added Ready-made meals to her offering as in person classes are now cancelled. Fresh or frozen and pick up or delivery. She is also looking at adding virtual cooking classes. <a href="https://relishmama.com.au/homemade-ready-made-meals/">https://relishmama.com.au/homemade-ready-made-meals/</a></li>
<li><strong>Scicluna’s</strong> is a fresh fruit and vegetable market and is now offering Grab &amp; Go boxes, either pick up or delivery from multiple locations. 3 ready packed boxes available. <a href="https://sciclunas.com.au/sciclunas-grab-go">https://sciclunas.com.au/sciclunas-grab-go</a></li>

<p>Most retail stores have an online presence already, the challenge now is to get found. If they don’t, now is the perfect time to add that revenue stream.<br />
Many local government councils are offering grants to finance this upgrade to your website.<br />
Check out the links below.</p>
<p>If your website doesn’t rank in Google you really need to consider Google Shopping or Google Ads to ensure your products get found. Consider adding these costs into any funding requests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Creative industries</strong></h2>
<p>The creatives industry includes artists, writers, hairdressers and beauticians.</p>
<p>Facebook is currently filled with businesses pivoting however it’s hard to find these services.</p>
<p>Some interesting ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>School holiday activities &#8211; virtual online art or writing classes</li>
<li>Artists can also apply to have an e-commerce facility added to their website – see here for details</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Fitness and Sports clubs</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Big Business</strong></h2>
<p>Small businesses aren&#8217;t the only ones adapting. With most large corporates all working virtually, there will be a need to maintain the culture and momentum regardless of staff location. Traditionally you would invest in team building exercises or events. Now Virtual Team Building is available and what a great initiative.<br />
In America a great new business in this area is Virtual Camp-fire nights. Although quite American the creativity is fantastic. This company&#8217;s offering includes “historic ghost stories, icebreaker questions, small competitions, and real s’mores.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Resources</strong></h2>
<p>A range of <a href="https://www.myob.com/au/blog/covid-19-goverment-support-for-businesses/">stimulus packages at both State and Federal levels are being rolled out</a>. Keep an eye on the news to ensure you keep up to date with what you’re entitled to. In particular is the City of Melbournes investment into retailers who have been hit hard. View the grant details <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/melbourne-city-council-grants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
<p>A number of financial institutions have also offered interest freezes and discounts, so be sure to check what you can take advantage of with your own providers. Most banks are offering great terms to support business in this period.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As a design agency we observe that an online store really needs to be starting their marketing as early as possible to build a following or audience to then launch to.  So many times people are eager to spend $1000's of dollars on the store but only to find when they launch there are crickets, no sales and marketing is hard work. </p>

			<p>Launching any business is full of tasks but to launch an e-commerce business is that much harder as there are more details to be considered.</p>
<p>These include inventory, product descriptions, refund policies, shipping, offers, customer service, great product photography, packaging, abandoned cart communications, up-selling to name a few,.</p>
<p>Not being prepared is a recipe for disaster which is why I’ve used all our client experiences to create a 7-point list to help you consider the marketing launch side of your new online store.</p>

<h6>PIC: from one of our clients who has an amazing brand aligned Instagram page. Sarah links the promotions with her products and time of the year very successfully. Her feed is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stateofelliott/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and her online store is <a href="https://stateofelliott.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Secure your social handles
<ul>
<li>This is really important from a brand perspective and ideally you would do this when you have registered your domain name and business name. You do not want it to be different as that makes life confusing for your customers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose the right platform
<ul>
<li>Your product and audience will determine the best social platform for you. Consider where your target market hangs out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up your profile with great pics
<ul>
<li>Use your brand guidelines and keep it consistent.</li>
<li>Where possible get professional photo’s taken to make a great first impression</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a content calendar plan
<ul>
<li>Mapping out your themes for posting will help with content creation and your feed will look fabulous from a brand perspective. Consistency is a great way to build followers and trust.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Link the tracking codes to your website so you monitor which performs the best</li>
<li>Consider which to integrate as an additional sales channel. You may wish to test one first or all at once. Each platform has a slightly different audience so best to create a strategy for each. Could be less burdensome to test the best one first, track effectiveness before launching into a second. (see our links below to our trusted suppliers if you wish to outsource this task)</li>
<li>We often observe, very importantly that you need to start your marketing as early as possible to build a pre-launch audience.  Using Social is a very cost effective way to do this. Blogging and sharing your &#8216;brand&#8217; voice and value to gain a following is highly beneficial so that when you launch you have an audience watching.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>2. Get Your Email Marketing Ready&#8230;.. </strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1871" height="1238" class="wp-image-12345" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/active-campaign-email-marketing-crm-ecommerce-online-stores.png" alt="active-campaign-email-marketing-crm-ecommerce-online-stores" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/active-campaign-email-marketing-crm-ecommerce-online-stores.png 1871w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/active-campaign-email-marketing-crm-ecommerce-online-stores-300x199.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/active-campaign-email-marketing-crm-ecommerce-online-stores-768x508.png 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/active-campaign-email-marketing-crm-ecommerce-online-stores-1024x678.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1871px) 100vw, 1871px" /></figure>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Choose your email provider<br />There are many providers out there that have free accounts with basics. Here are a few, some free and some paid:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mailchimp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.activecampaign.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Campaign</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.constantcontact.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constant Contact</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Campaign Monitor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.getresponse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Response</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design email communications and a newsletter template
<ul>
<li>Think about the audience and what they really want to know. A newsletter is not about selling products directly, tell stories, build trust, solve problems while also promoting offers</li>
<li>Plan your calendar
<ol type="a">
<li>Create a range of topics to share that coincide with what is relevant to your target audience life, in the news, relates to times of the year. I’ve made a full list of some dates for you <a href="/e-commerce-calendar/">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Consider the customer process emails, what they look like and content to make you stand out. These can be automated and can include:
<ol type="a">
<li>Welcome series</li>
<li>E-receipts</li>
<li>Abandoned cart notifications</li>
<li>Order confirmation</li>
<li>Shipping notifications</li>
<li>Order review request</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. Install Analytics&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>Analytics are important to set up from day one. This data will give you valuable insight into your visitors and customers, their activity on your site and what is working well and what needs improvement.</p>
<p>If you use Shopify as your online store platform it has its own set of analytics reporting built in, but we suggest you also install <a href="https://www.shopify.com.au/blog/14681601-google-analytics-for-ecommerce-a-beginners-guide">Google Analytics</a>. There are plenty of other options in the market but Google Analytics is one of the most well-known and popular analytics tools.<br /><a id="keyword"></a></p>

<h2><strong>4. Do Your Keyword Research&#8230;..</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1487" height="861" class="wp-image-12400" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool.png" alt="launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool.png 1487w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-300x174.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-768x445.png 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-1024x593.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1487px) 100vw, 1487px" /></figure>
<p>The preparation for this task is all around what do you want to be found for? Another way to consider prepping your site and product pages is to answer this question What will your customer be using as the phrases or key words in Google to find your products? You can also use the search bar in Google that predicts what you are searching for as broad guessing but for accurate data you will need a Google Adwords account. Within the dashboard once logged in (top nav Tools) you can use the Keyword Planner to find exact statistics on what phrases people are using to find your products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>If you use Shopify as your online store platform it has its own SEO fields at the bottom of each product page to be completed. If you use WordPress / Woo Commerce you will need to add an SEO plugin such as Yoast, it one of the most well-known and popular SEO tools.</li>
<li>Check Page Titles
<ul>
<li>Check that page titles are appropriate and optimised for search. They should include key terms and be formatted correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check Meta Descriptions
<ul>
<li>Ensure that all media elements on your site such as your page images or product images have meta descriptions and titles. These should be relevant to your content and descriptive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check URLs
<ul>
<li>Check that all of your URLs are simple and relevant to the page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5. Decide Your KPI&#8217;s&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Starting a business it is important to know your numbers. Such as:
<ul>
<li>How much does my product cost, per unit, landed to customer front door?</li>
<li>What are the true shipping costs. This means you need to include, all fulfillment components, such as staff related picking and packing costs, software, postage, packaging etc.?</li>
<li>What are your merchant processing fees?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set yourself very specific revenue goals, down to daily numbers, this helps you understand what activity you need to do to achieve the sales goals and will help with testing what sales tactics, channels work more successfully. Your product may have an expiration date, so moving product by set dates will be vital. You don’t want to be stuck with unsellable inventory.</li>
<li>Look for ways to cut costs, as your sales volume increases you maybe able to negotiate raw material bulk discounts or better shipping rates.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>6. Know Your Shipping Strategy&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="752" class="wp-image-12404" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-1024x752.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-1024x752.jpg 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-300x220.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-768x564.jpg 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Online Store Packaging
<ul>
<li>Unboxing has become an opportunity to surprise and delight your customer, an opportunity to make a great first impression. A UK packaging company did a survey and found that 20% of packaging was not a good fit for the product, and 15% used too much packaging. Also 7% of products arrived damaged as a result of inappropriate packaging. This is a vital part of your launch. Some other useful information from this survey to help you with your online store packaging is:
<ol type="a">
<li>appropriateness of outer packaging size</li>
<li>durability of packaging</li>
<li>ease of opening</li>
<li>amount of packaging materials used</li>
<li>recyclability of packaging</li>
<li>ability to use packaging for returns</li>
<li>use of branding</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shipping options
<ul>
<li>Make shipping as easy as possible with a couple of options that make the customers life easier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shipping costs and times
<ul>
<li>Be clear about these so that you manage a customers expectations, including tracking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>7. Finalise the Launch promotion&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Running a giveaway is a great launch marketing tactic to get traffic and subscribers quickly. Giveaways have the added benefit of increasing your brand presence and product visibility especially when launching. Building an email list gives you a group of warm leads to work with, making the sales process much easier. Your first product reviews will be useful for many platforms so the more of these you get while in the early days the better.</li>
<li>You can provide first-time visitors with a discount coupon or voucher when they first land to use at checkout consumers can help boost sales.</li>
<li>Create a plan that includes your chosen social platform.</li>
<li>Get media
<ul>
<li>You may have an opportunity to get media depending on your personal story and how it relates to the launch of your product.</li>
<li>It could be beneficial to delay your launch or speed it up to leverage off what is topical or in the news.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plan the launch and first impressions.
<ul>
<li>You only get to launch once so make it count; first sales, first customer interactions, first social engagement, these all count.</li>
<li>Prepare for mistakes as things will not go to plan! This can include a ‘make good’ message / gift or a clever ‘404’ page on your website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Affiliates / Partners
<ul>
<li>You can investigate partner and affiliate marketing to boost your brand presence by offering affiliate marketing options and partnering with other online retailers.</li>
<li>You can offer bloggers who share your target audience a free sample of your product in exchange for reviews. If you’re selling products on Amazon, one easy way to gain consumer respect and confidence (and reviews) is to ask for feedback. Include a card with each product that asks for an honest review and provides contact information for your company</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Have you heard Google want you to switch your site to HTTPS?</h1>
<p>#updated July 2018 &#8211; this is now more important than last year and all sites need to have an HTTPS.</p>
<h3>Firstly what is HTTPS?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure</strong></span> (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The &#8216;S&#8217; at the end of HTTPS stands for &#8216;Secure&#8217;. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. So essentially an https offers a secure method for hosting your website. It’s recongnised by the padlock in the browser bar.</p>
<h3>Some background information.</h3>
<p>In 2014 Google announced in a campaign that they would start to rank secure pages over unsecure ones. 3 years later and now it’s more than just a ranking issues, Google and many others want the web to be more secure in general. If you think about it we want that too. We all know how our information is taken and stored for re-targetting and it is only going to become more invasive of our surfing activities.</p>
<p>In August 2014 Google had their HTTPS everywhere campaign, they announced HTTPS as a ranking signal.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cBhZ6S0PFCY?ecver=1" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first they noted that “for now it’s only a very lightweight signal,” but over time Google “may decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to encourage all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.” Then on Sept. 8, 2016 <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/09/moving-towards-more-secure-web.html">Google announced</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SSL-blog-turn-my-site-into-https.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4062 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SSL-blog-turn-my-site-into-https-e1488491428543.png" alt="SSL-blog-turn-my-site-into-https" width="662" height="231" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Early this year, 2017,</strong> </span>version 56 of the Chrome web browser was released. There is a significant change in the way it displays websites that are not using HTTPS, also known as holding an SSL certificate. This change may confuse your site visitors or surprise you if you are not expecting it.</p>
<p>Starting with the release of Chrome 56 in Januart, any website that is not running HTTPS will have a message appear in the location bar that says “Not Secure” on pages that collect passwords or credit cards. It will look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/not_secure.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3971" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/not_secure.png" alt="not_secure-turn-my-site-into-https" width="300" height="136" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may confuse your site visitors who land on your site or sign into it because they may interpret the message to indicate that your website has been compromised. They could also interpret the message to mean that your site has some underlying security issue other than being non-HTTPS. The initial changes will affect websites that collect login and credit card information over http but as Google rolls out their plan to secure web privacy across the internet we can be sure that change is coming soon and it is sensible to get it sorted sooner rather than later.</p>
<h3>The nitty gritty of why you should make your site an HTTPS?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong> Google identifies several reasons to switch to HTTPS in their website migration guide:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Encrypting</strong> the exchanged data to keep it secure from eavesdroppers. That means that while the user is browsing a website, nobody can “listen” to their conversations, track their activities across multiple pages or steal their information.</li>
<li><strong>Data integrity. </strong>Data cannot be modified or corrupted during transfer, intentionally or otherwise, without being detected.</li>
<li>Proves that your users communicate with the intended website. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks and builds user trust, which translates into other business benefits.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> SSL benefit to search rankings. </strong>Everyone with a business website wants to achieve strong rankings in the SERPS (search engine results pages) — but it isn’t easy. With literally hundreds of different and evolving criteria used in Google’s algorithm, you want to use every available tool to your advantage. <strong>SSL encryption can help your website rank higher in search results.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Trust: </strong>If you have contact forms on your site or need to take any information, seeing the HTTPS and green padlock will add to the trust perception and let potential contacts know their submission is protected and that you are not a fly-by-night operation. Certificate Authorities also offer <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/find-my-site-seal-code-3441">Trust Seals</a> that you can display on your site. In addition to the padlock and HTTPS in your browser location bar, these graphics give website visitors an additional visual indication that you have SSL encryption in place.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>How do you transfer from HTTP to an HTTPS?</h3>
<p>There are quite a few steps involved to move to an HTTPS, Google has a guide <u><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6073543?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</u> In essence you need to purchase an SSL Certificate, load it onto your website sever then map all the pages / images / content / links ulrs from http to https.</p>

<h3>If you like details and want to know more, here is the &#8216;how&#8217;.</h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;"> <span style="color: #cb0044;">Step 1 is to purchase an SSL Certificate.</span></span></h4>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Types Of SSL Certificate</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous types and brands of SSL Certificate and whilst they all work using the same principle they do offer different features.</p>
<p>Here is a high level overview:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain SSL</strong> – Most popular type of SSL. Browser Padlock shows. Domain Name only appears in browser bar. Low cost and instant issue. No paperwork, no waiting. Limited to one domain only. (The type we are offering to install)</li>
<li><strong>Wildcard SSL</strong> – Same as Domain SSL but extends to sub domains of this domain (not available on Extended SSL – see below)</li>
<li><strong>Organization SSL</strong> – More expensive SSL with domain ownership and Company verification required. Usually issued in 1 to 2 business days. Browser Padlock shows with Domain Name &amp; Company Name appearing.</li>
<li><strong>Extended SSL</strong> – Most expensive type of SSL which requires domain ownership and Company verification as well as legal, physical &amp; operational verification required. Usually issued within 3 to 4 business days. Extended validation with green browser bar showing company name.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2 Install SSL Certificate</h4>
<p>For the purpose of brevity we will assume that a Domain SSL is being purchased as you are a single person business and are concerned with the installation of the SSL and the switch to HTTPS rather than the vetting procedure of an Organization or Extended SSL.</p>
<p>Your webmaster or hosting company will then create the Certificate Signing Request and perform the installation of the certificate.</p>
<p>To install an SSL your site must have a Dedicated IP address. If your site doesn’t have a dedicated IP address you will need to change your hosting plan or host. Some hosts will do this once you start the installation process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 3 Backup Your Website</h4>
<p>As a security measure before redirecting your site to HTTPS we recommend making a full backup of your website.</p>
<p>This is an optional step and is only in case there are any issues and you need to restore your files. As a rule it is sensible to take a back-up of your site regularly.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 4 Configure Hard Links In Your Website</h4>
<p>Because you are switching from HTTP to HTTPS the internal links in your website need to reflect this otherwise they will return 404 errors (file not found).</p>
<p>If you have a small website you can do this by hand or get a Developer to make these changes.</p>
<p>However, if you have a large site maybe hundreds or even thousands of pages there are tools that can help you to do this very quickly.</p>
<p>If you use WordPress you can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/velvet-blues-update-urls/">Velvet Blues Update URLs Plugin</a> or the <a href="https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/">interconnectit – search replace php script</a>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 5 Update Tools &amp; Code Libraries</h4>
<p>This usually won’t apply unless you have a larger, more complex website.</p>
<p>If you are using different tools for your website for extra functionality such as JavaScript or Ajax then be sure to update these so that they will work when you switch to HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 6 Change Any External Links Under Your Control</h4>
<p>If you have external websites pointing to your site (i.e. backlinks) you should change any that you have under your control from HTTP to HTTPS. Mostly these will be things like directory listings.</p>
<p>Most of the time they won’t be under your control though but don’t worry about this as you will be making changes later that will redirect any HTTP traffic to HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 7 Implement 301 Redirects</h4>
<p>A 301 redirect is a permanent redirection that you can set up to tell any HTTP traffic to now go to the HTTPS equivalent.</p>
<p>If you are not an experienced Web Professional then this is probably best left to a developer.</p>
<p>Depending on your webserver you will need to setup sitewide direction.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 8 Update Links In 3rd Party Tools &amp; Transactional Emails</h4>
<p>If you’re using any third party applications such an email marketing tool, marketing automation or Customer Relationship Management tool then you’ll need to run a manual check on any links that you’ve created there to make sure they’re all up to date.</p>
<p>Likewise if you have a billing system your transactional emails such as welcome emails and any invoice emails need to be updated to reflect the change. Of course the redirection you’ve set up previously will forward any HTTP links to the HTTPS equivalent but it’s always more professional to correct these.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 9 Update Landing Pages &amp; Paid Search Links</h4>
<p>If you have any landing pages setup then these will have been updated automatically by the 301 redirect but for completeness you should double check these.</p>
<p>Also check the links you are using in the paid search tools you are using whether that’s Google, Facebook or whatever.</p>
<p>Also if you use a Landing Page generator then you should update your setting there to reflect the switch.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 10 Update Google Search Console &amp; Google Analytics</h4>
<p>Finally you need to make sure that you update your Google Search Console (Google Webmaster Tools) by submitting the new HTTPS site as well as re-submitting your SiteMap.</p>
<p>Also don’t forget Google Analytics to make sure that you can get the correct analytics. That’s just a question of setting the ‘Default URL’ to HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Wrap Up</h3>
<p>Switching to HTTPS has a few steps involved. But increasingly security is important and sooner or later you will need to make the switch.</p>
<p>Choose the right sort of SSL for your needs. There are several types and whilst they all work the same there are varying degrees of verification and also the way the browser appears, such as the green browser bar.</p>
