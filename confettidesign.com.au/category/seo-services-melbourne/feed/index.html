<h2><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-14688 aligncenter" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot-1024x831.png" alt="" width="1024" height="831" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot-1024x831.png 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot-300x243.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot-768x623.png 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fever-smile_screenshot.png 1345w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />When does the application close?</h2>
<p>The rebate applications will be available from the 1<sup>st</sup> December 2020 to 31<sup>st</sup> March 2021, or until the funds for the program are exhausted. If success, Confetti Design hopes the Victorian Government continues this digital initiative to help small businesses with their websites and e-commerce stores including Shopify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How quickly will I receive the rebate?</h2>
<p>As a small business, you will be contacted by the Victorian Government within six weeks to ensure you have started to use your selected digital product and payment. Once the Government has confirmation of the continued use of the digital product, you will receive the $1,200 rebate within 10 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Is my small business eligible?</h2>
<p>To be eligible for the rebate, your business will need to be located in Victoria and held an ABN since 13<sup>th</sup> September 2019. You will also need to be registered for GST on the 13<sup>th</sup> September 2020.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-14689 aligncenter" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot-1024x831.png" alt="" width="1024" height="831" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot-1024x831.png 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot-300x243.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot-768x623.png 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fresh-delish_screenshot.png 1345w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />What if I already use one of the digital products?</h2>
<p>To be eligible for the program, you need to ensure the digital product is a new adaption and is not currently being used by the business. The great news is that the eligibility includes upgrading an existing product with additional features that provide greater digital capability. If you have used one of the products such as Shopify in the past, which is more than a year ago, and resume the adoption of the digital product you will also be eligible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What doesn’t the program cover?</h2>
<p>The program does not cover renewals of existing digital products provided as part of the program. It also does not include minor updates to existing products. Most importantly, the digital product, such as Shopify, must be available under the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How will I know how to use the digital products available under the <em>Small Business Digital Adaption Program </em>?</h2>
<p>Once you are registered under the program, free training and workshops are available and training dates are available in the training calendar that is published on the <a href="https://www.business.vic.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Victoria</a> website. The training and workshops are run across Melbourne metropolitan area and also in regional Victoria. The great news is if you are currently using one of the available products you can also attend the workshop and training days.</p>

			<h6>Learning management systems (LMS) are software platforms that enable businesses to build and deliver educational courses. Many consumers are looking to increase their skill set and knowledge by completing online training programs, rather than physically attending schools. An LMS delivers content, which can include knowledge documents, videos, courses and quizzes. The team at Confetti Design has delivered several projects using the learning management system <em>Access Ally</em>, and we thought it was worthwhile to review and detail this LMS.</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is <em>Access Alley</em>?</h2>
<p>Many LMS are not a stand-alone system and are plugins for websites such as WordPress. <em>Access Ally</em> is a complete plugin for WordPress that enables small business to build an  online learning business within their WordPress small business website. <em>Access Ally </em>focuses on deep CRM integration, and simplifies the process to add tests, progress the tracking of course completion, video links or anything else you would like to offer on your course pages. <em>Access Ally</em>  supports the upload of student work. The key selling point for <em>Access Ally</em> is its integration with your existing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How did <em>Access Ally</em> start?</h2>
<p><em>Access Ally </em>began as way to manage access to online courses and quickly developed into a full service membership plugin. <em>Access Ally </em>has WordPress-themed order forms that allows users to offer one-time payments, subscriptions. It is enhanced with individually triggered time-sensitive coupons, including trial offers, and 1-click upsells to your customers. <em>Access Ally </em>enables members to manage their credit cards that are on file and their subscriptions from within Access Ally.</p>
<h2><em>Access Ally</em> Pricing – A Simple Offer</h2>
<p><em>Access Ally </em> has a transparent pricing offer ,where subscribers pay one flat fee, regardless of the number of courses, memberships, or members a small business will have. Even better, <em>Access Ally </em>does not take commissions on any of your online course sales, and integrates with Stripe and PayPal straight out of the box.</p>
<h2>Why <em>Access Ally </em>over other Learning Management Systems</h2>
<p><em>Access Ally </em>prides its on being the one tool that simply handles everything<em> &#8211;</em> from accepting payments, the ability to create courses, easy integrations with online tools such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Active Campaign</li>
<li>Convert Kit</li>
<li>Drip</li>
<li>Infusionsoft</li>
<li>Keap</li>
<li>Ontraport, and of course CRM’s.</li>
</ol>
<p>It offers the best member management of any LMS on the market. There is effortless integration of <em>Access Ally’s</em> learning management system (LMS) with your existing CRM. Small business will not need to pay for and integrate additional plugins to handle payments and payment administration, membership levels to run cohesive membership sites, and integration with your CRM for marketing automation. Some of the course features include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant and dripped courses</li>
<li>Team accounts</li>
<li>Progress tracking of courses</li>
<li>Homework submissions</li>
<li>Video view tracking and bookmarks</li>
<li>Quizzes and Certificates</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Access Ally</em> Functionality – the Course Creation Wizard</strong></p>
<p>The team at Confetti Design found the ease of use and functionality of <em>Access Ally&#8217;s Course Creation Wizard</em> a great selling point for this LMS as it creates courses as a WordPress page. Small business can easily keep their content, or import it into another LMS product later. When evaluating LMS’s for our small business website customers, we found many business lose access to their content if they decide to cancel their LMS subscription, which is not the case with <em>Access Ally</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Access Ally </em>enables small business to select your LMS compatible “WordPress theme” for functionality, speed, design flexibility, and features. There is no requirement for someone who can code in CSS to make the design, such as buttons and breadcrumbs, look and feel modern. It’s all in <em>Access Ally</em>!</p>
<p><strong><em><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have put together five main reasons why your e-commerce website needs a blog.</p>
<p>A lot of things should be considered when maintaining a high performing e-commerce website. One important element you must consider is creating and maintaining a blog. A place to share articles, tips, resources or how to videos. Basically any kind of content to add value to your customers.  Fresh regular content helps your website remain relevant,  allowing you to build your brand voice and increase awareness of you and your products.</p>
<h2><strong><br />
1. Search Engine Optimisation</strong></h2>
<p>A well written blog ensures that there is educative content that can be indexed by search engines. It ultimately helps your online store be more searchable by related topics, hence generating more visitors to your site.</p>
<p>Blogs help enhance the quality of SEO since it points appropriate answers of customer inquiries to your website. Blog posts that use quality SEO tactics such as targeting relevant keywords, placing them strategically on titles, and writing appropriate meta data descriptions give your e-commerce site the opportunity to rank in search engines—and this is always good for business!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>2. Increase Traffic on your Website</strong></h2>
<p>As a business owner, your goal is to pique the interest of your target market, so that they will visit your site and increase your chances of making a sale. Posting your blog links in social media increases your chances to accomplish that goal.</p>
<p>Create a blog which is catchy, informative, and up to date. Posting these blog links in your store’s social media accounts will serve as an ad for your website. Depending on how useful your blogs are to the readers, the blog link will generate clicks and drive visitors /  traffic to your website, which is a big step towards increasing your sales!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. Brand Identity</strong></h2>
<p>There are numerous steps into starting up your brand identity. You’ll have to think about your niche, your market, a catchy <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/how-to-name-small-business/">brand name</a>, and most especially—building your brand identity.</p>
<p>When you think about a product, a specific brand usually comes to mind. For example, when thinking about carbonated drinks or soft drinks, you’ll probably think about Coca Cola. Or when thinking about toothpaste, you’ll immediately think about Colgate. These brands established their identity throughout the years by executing effective marketing strategies, which helped them gain the trust and loyalty of their customers. Same can be done with e-commerce websites. A blog is another tool to use in establishing your identity in a world full of rival brands and similar products.</p>
<p>Blogging provides a voice to your business.  You can use it to build your business’s unique personality which separates you from your competitors. Things to consider are what do you want to be known for that are also important to your customer? How can you give personality and life to your brand through your writing?  Your initial blogs could include answers to the basic identity questions: 1- who are you, and 2- what value your product or service gives to your customers. These will be ingrained in your readers’ minds as you write more and more articles on your website. In time, your readers may become your customers and eventually, your brand ambassadors!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>4. Build an Online Community</strong></h2>
<p>If you keep posting helpful and relative blogs consistently, your community of readers which are originally your searchers will keep going back to your site for new information. The comments that your viewers leave in your blog will spark a meaningful conversation with like minded people about the topics.</p>
<p>Blogs that are personalized and relatable are the ones readers usually react to. Make your blogging as inclusive and interactive as possible, specially when you are trying to build a community of brand supporters. Write about how your product contributes or solves a problem in their life. Encourage comments and conversations within your blog as these will also help in making your blog rank higher in related topics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5. Enhance Your Writing Skills</strong></h2>
<p>As important as having including a blog in your e-commerce website is, making sure your content is relevant and easy to read it also vital. Writing them doesn’t just keep you well connected to your business and your brand, but also helps develop your communication skills.</p>
<p>Here are some factors to consider when you are starting to write a blog for your online store:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your relevance. </strong>If not talking about products or services you offer, your blog should always have a connection to what your online store is offering.</li>
<li><strong>Your audience. </strong>Some blog writers are so used to using technical terms that they forget to consider who the target audience is. Basic rule is to make sure your writing style is conversational and simple. A common standard is aim for it to be understood by a high schooler! Writing like the way you talk is often a great start. Ultimately the goal is to engage your target audience so they stay on your site for longer.</li>
<li><strong>Your structure. </strong>Keep a structure which allows your audience to fully digest your blog content. The basic structure of a blog is 1-having an introduction of the topic, 2- giving more details about the topic and sub topics, and finally, summarising the main message of your blog. Structure using a hierarchy of information is also important for ranking. Google is more likely to rank your articles if they are structures logically.</li>
<li><strong>Your consistency</strong>. Decide on whether you will write a blog on a weekly or a monthly basis. This will not only help you rank higher in search engines—it will also keep your customers informed of the current trends and news about your business. This will gain more engagement to your current and future customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The e-commerce world is growing rapidly, hence the continued importance of having a blog for your website. You may start with simple blogs and then later evolve to longer ones and don&#8217;t forget you can also include video, images or infographics. What is important though is you start now and reap its benefits not only for your online store but also to your ranking. With all these gains (and nothing to lose), why don’t you start blogging now?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As a design agency we observe that an online store really needs to be starting their marketing as early as possible to build a following or audience to then launch to.  So many times people are eager to spend $1000's of dollars on the store but only to find when they launch there are crickets, no sales and marketing is hard work. </p>

			<p>Launching any business is full of tasks but to launch an e-commerce business is that much harder as there are more details to be considered.</p>

<h6>PIC: from one of our clients who has an amazing brand aligned Instagram page. Sarah links the promotions with her products and time of the year very successfully. Her feed is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stateofelliott/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and her online store is <a href="https://stateofelliott.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Secure your social handles
<ul>
<li>This is really important from a brand perspective and ideally you would do this when you have registered your domain name and business name. You do not want it to be different as that makes life confusing for your customers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose the right platform
<ul>
<li>Your product and audience will determine the best social platform for you. Consider where your target market hangs out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up your profile with great pics
<ul>
<li>Use your brand guidelines and keep it consistent.</li>
<li>Where possible get professional photo’s taken to make a great first impression</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a content calendar plan
<ul>
<li>Mapping out your themes for posting will help with content creation and your feed will look fabulous from a brand perspective. Consistency is a great way to build followers and trust.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Link the tracking codes to your website so you monitor which performs the best</li>
<li>Consider which to integrate as an additional sales channel. You may wish to test one first or all at once. Each platform has a slightly different audience so best to create a strategy for each. Could be less burdensome to test the best one first, track effectiveness before launching into a second. (see our links below to our trusted suppliers if you wish to outsource this task)</li>
<li>We often observe, very importantly that you need to start your marketing as early as possible to build a pre-launch audience.  Using Social is a very cost effective way to do this. Blogging and sharing your &#8216;brand&#8217; voice and value to gain a following is highly beneficial so that when you launch you have an audience watching.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>2. Get Your Email Marketing Ready&#8230;.. </strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Choose your email provider<br />There are many providers out there that have free accounts with basics. Here are a few, some free and some paid:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mailchimp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.activecampaign.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Campaign</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.getresponse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Response</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design email communications and a newsletter template
<ul>
<li>Think about the audience and what they really want to know. A newsletter is not about selling products directly, tell stories, build trust, solve problems while also promoting offers</li>
<li>Plan your calendar
<ol type="a">
<li>Create a range of topics to share that coincide with what is relevant to your target audience life, in the news, relates to times of the year. I’ve made a full list of some dates for you <a href="/e-commerce-calendar/">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Consider the customer process emails, what they look like and content to make you stand out. These can be automated and can include:
<ol type="a">
<li>Welcome series</li>
<li>E-receipts</li>
<li>Abandoned cart notifications</li>
<li>Order confirmation</li>
<li>Shipping notifications</li>
<li>Order review request</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. Install Analytics&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>Analytics are important to set up from day one. This data will give you valuable insight into your visitors and customers, their activity on your site and what is working well and what needs improvement.</p>
<p>If you use Shopify as your online store platform it has its own set of analytics reporting built in, but we suggest you also install <a href="https://www.shopify.com.au/blog/14681601-google-analytics-for-ecommerce-a-beginners-guide">Google Analytics</a>. There are plenty of other options in the market but Google Analytics is one of the most well-known and popular analytics tools.<br /><a id="keyword"></a></p>

<h2><strong>4. Do Your Keyword Research&#8230;..</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1487" height="861" class="wp-image-12400" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool.png" alt="launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool.png 1487w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-300x174.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-768x445.png 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-1024x593.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1487px) 100vw, 1487px" /></figure>
<p>The preparation for this task is all around what do you want to be found for? Another way to consider prepping your site and product pages is to answer this question What will your customer be using as the phrases or key words in Google to find your products? You can also use the search bar in Google that predicts what you are searching for as broad guessing but for accurate data you will need a Google Adwords account. Within the dashboard once logged in (top nav Tools) you can use the Keyword Planner to find exact statistics on what phrases people are using to find your products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>If you use Shopify as your online store platform it has its own SEO fields at the bottom of each product page to be completed. If you use WordPress / Woo Commerce you will need to add an SEO plugin such as Yoast, it one of the most well-known and popular SEO tools.</li>
<li>Check Page Titles
<ul>
<li>Check that page titles are appropriate and optimised for search. They should include key terms and be formatted correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check Meta Descriptions
<ul>
<li>Ensure that all media elements on your site such as your page images or product images have meta descriptions and titles. These should be relevant to your content and descriptive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check URLs
<ul>
<li>Check that all of your URLs are simple and relevant to the page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5. Decide Your KPI&#8217;s&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Starting a business it is important to know your numbers. Such as:
<ul>
<li>How much does my product cost, per unit, landed to customer front door?</li>
<li>What are the true shipping costs. This means you need to include, all fulfillment components, such as staff related picking and packing costs, software, postage, packaging etc.?</li>
<li>What are your merchant processing fees?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set yourself very specific revenue goals, down to daily numbers, this helps you understand what activity you need to do to achieve the sales goals and will help with testing what sales tactics, channels work more successfully. Your product may have an expiration date, so moving product by set dates will be vital. You don’t want to be stuck with unsellable inventory.</li>
<li>Look for ways to cut costs, as your sales volume increases you maybe able to negotiate raw material bulk discounts or better shipping rates.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>6. Know Your Shipping Strategy&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="752" class="wp-image-12404" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-1024x752.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-1024x752.jpg 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-300x220.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-768x564.jpg 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Online Store Packaging
<ul>
<li>Unboxing has become an opportunity to surprise and delight your customer, an opportunity to make a great first impression. A UK packaging company did a survey and found that 20% of packaging was not a good fit for the product, and 15% used too much packaging. Also 7% of products arrived damaged as a result of inappropriate packaging. This is a vital part of your launch. Some other useful information from this survey to help you with your online store packaging is:
<ol type="a">
<li>appropriateness of outer packaging size</li>
<li>durability of packaging</li>
<li>ease of opening</li>
<li>amount of packaging materials used</li>
<li>recyclability of packaging</li>
<li>ability to use packaging for returns</li>
<li>use of branding</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shipping options
<ul>
<li>Make shipping as easy as possible with a couple of options that make the customers life easier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shipping costs and times
<ul>
<li>Be clear about these so that you manage a customers expectations, including tracking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>7. Finalise the Launch promotion&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Running a giveaway is a great launch marketing tactic to get traffic and subscribers quickly. Giveaways have the added benefit of increasing your brand presence and product visibility especially when launching. Building an email list gives you a group of warm leads to work with, making the sales process much easier. Your first product reviews will be useful for many platforms so the more of these you get while in the early days the better.</li>
<li>You can provide first-time visitors with a discount coupon or voucher when they first land to use at checkout consumers can help boost sales.</li>
<li>Create a plan that includes your chosen social platform.</li>
<li>Get media
<ul>
<li>You may have an opportunity to get media depending on your personal story and how it relates to the launch of your product.</li>
<li>It could be beneficial to delay your launch or speed it up to leverage off what is topical or in the news.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plan the launch and first impressions.
<ul>
<li>You only get to launch once so make it count; first sales, first customer interactions, first social engagement, these all count.</li>
<li>Prepare for mistakes as things will not go to plan! This can include a ‘make good’ message / gift or a clever ‘404’ page on your website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Affiliates / Partners
<ul>
<li>You can investigate partner and affiliate marketing to boost your brand presence by offering affiliate marketing options and partnering with other online retailers.</li>
<li>You can offer bloggers who share your target audience a free sample of your product in exchange for reviews. If you’re selling products on Amazon, one easy way to gain consumer respect and confidence (and reviews) is to ask for feedback. Include a card with each product that asks for an honest review and provides contact information for your company</li>
</ul>
</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Have you heard Google want you to switch your site to HTTPS?</h1>
<p>#updated July 2018 &#8211; this is now more important than last year and all sites need to have an HTTPS.</p>
<h3>Firstly what is HTTPS?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure</strong></span> (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The &#8216;S&#8217; at the end of HTTPS stands for &#8216;Secure&#8217;. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. So essentially an https offers a secure method for hosting your website. It’s recongnised by the padlock in the browser bar.</p>
<h3>Some background information.</h3>
<p>In 2014 Google announced in a campaign that they would start to rank secure pages over unsecure ones. 3 years later and now it’s more than just a ranking issues, Google and many others want the web to be more secure in general. If you think about it we want that too. We all know how our information is taken and stored for re-targetting and it is only going to become more invasive of our surfing activities.</p>
<p>In August 2014 Google had their HTTPS everywhere campaign, they announced HTTPS as a ranking signal.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cBhZ6S0PFCY?ecver=1" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first they noted that “for now it’s only a very lightweight signal,” but over time Google “may decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to encourage all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.” Then on Sept. 8, 2016 <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/09/moving-towards-more-secure-web.html">Google announced</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SSL-blog-turn-my-site-into-https.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4062 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SSL-blog-turn-my-site-into-https-e1488491428543.png" alt="SSL-blog-turn-my-site-into-https" width="662" height="231" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Early this year, 2017,</strong> </span>version 56 of the Chrome web browser was released. There is a significant change in the way it displays websites that are not using HTTPS, also known as holding an SSL certificate. This change may confuse your site visitors or surprise you if you are not expecting it.</p>
<p>Starting with the release of Chrome 56 in Januart, any website that is not running HTTPS will have a message appear in the location bar that says “Not Secure” on pages that collect passwords or credit cards. It will look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/not_secure.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3971" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/not_secure.png" alt="not_secure-turn-my-site-into-https" width="300" height="136" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may confuse your site visitors who land on your site or sign into it because they may interpret the message to indicate that your website has been compromised. They could also interpret the message to mean that your site has some underlying security issue other than being non-HTTPS. The initial changes will affect websites that collect login and credit card information over http but as Google rolls out their plan to secure web privacy across the internet we can be sure that change is coming soon and it is sensible to get it sorted sooner rather than later.</p>
<h3>The nitty gritty of why you should make your site an HTTPS?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong> Google identifies several reasons to switch to HTTPS in their website migration guide:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Encrypting</strong> the exchanged data to keep it secure from eavesdroppers. That means that while the user is browsing a website, nobody can “listen” to their conversations, track their activities across multiple pages or steal their information.</li>
<li><strong>Data integrity. </strong>Data cannot be modified or corrupted during transfer, intentionally or otherwise, without being detected.</li>
<li>Proves that your users communicate with the intended website. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks and builds user trust, which translates into other business benefits.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> SSL benefit to search rankings. </strong>Everyone with a business website wants to achieve strong rankings in the SERPS (search engine results pages) — but it isn’t easy. With literally hundreds of different and evolving criteria used in Google’s algorithm, you want to use every available tool to your advantage. <strong>SSL encryption can help your website rank higher in search results.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Trust: </strong>If you have contact forms on your site or need to take any information, seeing the HTTPS and green padlock will add to the trust perception and let potential contacts know their submission is protected and that you are not a fly-by-night operation. Certificate Authorities also offer <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/find-my-site-seal-code-3441">Trust Seals</a> that you can display on your site. In addition to the padlock and HTTPS in your browser location bar, these graphics give website visitors an additional visual indication that you have SSL encryption in place.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>How do you transfer from HTTP to an HTTPS?</h3>
<p>There are quite a few steps involved to move to an HTTPS, Google has a guide <u><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6073543?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</u> In essence you need to purchase an SSL Certificate, load it onto your website sever then map all the pages / images / content / links ulrs from http to https.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Feeling Overwhelmed? Want to protect your site but need help?</h3>
<p>We can take care of all the technical issues for you and just make it happen!</p>

</div>
<h3></h3>
<h3>If you like details and want to know more, here is the &#8216;how&#8217;.</h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;"> <span style="color: #cb0044;">Step 1 is to purchase an SSL Certificate.</span></span></h4>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Types Of SSL Certificate</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous types and brands of SSL Certificate and whilst they all work using the same principle they do offer different features.</p>
<p>Here is a high level overview:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain SSL</strong> – Most popular type of SSL. Browser Padlock shows. Domain Name only appears in browser bar. Low cost and instant issue. No paperwork, no waiting. Limited to one domain only. (The type we are offering to install)</li>
<li><strong>Wildcard SSL</strong> – Same as Domain SSL but extends to sub domains of this domain (not available on Extended SSL – see below)</li>
<li><strong>Organization SSL</strong> – More expensive SSL with domain ownership and Company verification required. Usually issued in 1 to 2 business days. Browser Padlock shows with Domain Name &amp; Company Name appearing.</li>
<li><strong>Extended SSL</strong> – Most expensive type of SSL which requires domain ownership and Company verification as well as legal, physical &amp; operational verification required. Usually issued within 3 to 4 business days. Extended validation with green browser bar showing company name.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2 Install SSL Certificate</h4>
<p>For the purpose of brevity we will assume that a Domain SSL is being purchased as you are a single person business and are concerned with the installation of the SSL and the switch to HTTPS rather than the vetting procedure of an Organization or Extended SSL.</p>
<p>Your webmaster or hosting company will then create the Certificate Signing Request and perform the installation of the certificate.</p>
<p>To install an SSL your site must have a Dedicated IP address. If your site doesn’t have a dedicated IP address you will need to change your hosting plan or host. Some hosts will do this once you start the installation process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 3 Backup Your Website</h4>
<p>As a security measure before redirecting your site to HTTPS we recommend making a full backup of your website.</p>
<p>This is an optional step and is only in case there are any issues and you need to restore your files. As a rule it is sensible to take a back-up of your site regularly.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 4 Configure Hard Links In Your Website</h4>
<p>Because you are switching from HTTP to HTTPS the internal links in your website need to reflect this otherwise they will return 404 errors (file not found).</p>
<p>If you have a small website you can do this by hand or get a Developer to make these changes.</p>
<p>However, if you have a large site maybe hundreds or even thousands of pages there are tools that can help you to do this very quickly.</p>
<p>If you use WordPress you can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/velvet-blues-update-urls/">Velvet Blues Update URLs Plugin</a> or the <a href="https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/">interconnectit – search replace php script</a>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 5 Update Tools &amp; Code Libraries</h4>
<p>This usually won’t apply unless you have a larger, more complex website.</p>
<p>If you are using different tools for your website for extra functionality such as JavaScript or Ajax then be sure to update these so that they will work when you switch to HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 6 Change Any External Links Under Your Control</h4>
<p>If you have external websites pointing to your site (i.e. backlinks) you should change any that you have under your control from HTTP to HTTPS. Mostly these will be things like directory listings.</p>
<p>Most of the time they won’t be under your control though but don’t worry about this as you will be making changes later that will redirect any HTTP traffic to HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 7 Implement 301 Redirects</h4>
<p>A 301 redirect is a permanent redirection that you can set up to tell any HTTP traffic to now go to the HTTPS equivalent.</p>
<p>If you are not an experienced Web Professional then this is probably best left to a developer.</p>
<p>Depending on your webserver you will need to setup sitewide direction.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 8 Update Links In 3rd Party Tools &amp; Transactional Emails</h4>
<p>If you’re using any third party applications such an email marketing tool, marketing automation or Customer Relationship Management tool then you’ll need to run a manual check on any links that you’ve created there to make sure they’re all up to date.</p>
<p>Likewise if you have a billing system your transactional emails such as welcome emails and any invoice emails need to be updated to reflect the change. Of course the redirection you’ve set up previously will forward any HTTP links to the HTTPS equivalent but it’s always more professional to correct these.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 9 Update Landing Pages &amp; Paid Search Links</h4>
<p>If you have any landing pages setup then these will have been updated automatically by the 301 redirect but for completeness you should double check these.</p>
<p>Also check the links you are using in the paid search tools you are using whether that’s Google, Facebook or whatever.</p>
<p>Also if you use a Landing Page generator then you should update your setting there to reflect the switch.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 10 Update Google Search Console &amp; Google Analytics</h4>
<p>Finally you need to make sure that you update your Google Search Console (Google Webmaster Tools) by submitting the new HTTPS site as well as re-submitting your SiteMap.</p>
<p>Also don’t forget Google Analytics to make sure that you can get the correct analytics. That’s just a question of setting the ‘Default URL’ to HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Wrap Up</h3>
<p>Switching to HTTPS has a few steps involved. But increasingly security is important and sooner or later you will need to make the switch.</p>
<p>Choose the right sort of SSL for your needs. There are several types and whilst they all work the same there are varying degrees of verification and also the way the browser appears, such as the green browser bar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve tried your best to create your own website; you have labored for hours over the words to capture your visitor&#8217;s interest, you have added some pretty images. You are also getting good traffic to your website, but you wonder why most of these leads don’t convert and they leave after only a few seconds of visiting a page on your site. You will be rubbing your head asking why aren&#8217;t visitors staying on my website?</p>
<p>According to the Nielsen Norman Group, (leaders in user experience research) most users stick around less than 59 seconds. This means that if you are unable to capture your user’s attention in less than a minute, you’ve lost them. Frightening when you think of the effort already put into your small business website!</p>
<p>I’ve pulled together a few reasons why your visitors don’t stay on your website for long and what you might do to rectify the situation. Keep in mind with marketing, there is no absolute definative answer, it is a task of test and measure. Try addressing a few of these issues below then monitor the changes to behaviour in your analytics dashboard. (Just on this: if you don&#8217;t have analytics please do that first, you have invested in a website, respect that expenditure by monitoring what happens on it, who comes to it, where they come from)</p>
<p>You don’t need to do all of the suggestions below at once. And it goes without saying try the cheapest and quickest ideas first, test it out, observe results then try another idea.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your website design is not engaging or talking ‘to’ your customer</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The truth is we all judge the book by its cover, you are naive to think otherwise and losing opportunities. Design matters and clarity of message is important. Appealing to your customer is vital, if you can look at your site through their eyes is a good start.</p>
<p>If your site still looks like a design of 1992, or it’s not responding on a table or phone, then you actually do need to invest the dollars in a professional makeover design. If your site is responsive but not sure if it’s the design that is outdated or how to fix it, take advantage of a website and brand review. There are quite a few automated ones online and we also offer the service <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/website-audit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEBSITE AUDIT</a>.<br />
Benefit of a review is you get the perspective of a visitor, then you can try to fix the issues yourself before starting a complete re-design.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Your website content is difficult to read</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your design is not only about your choice of colors, graphics or images, but the colors of your text and background determine how easy your visitors can read and digest the content on your website. The simple truth is your website won’t convert well if it can’t be easily read. There are no particular fonts to use and which to avoid, however when in doubt use one font in 2 -3 sizes or thickness on light backgrounds. The next big tip is to break up all sections of copy with a hierarchy of really important summary headings, a secondary sub-heading then the body of the copy. This breaks the information into bit sized pieces for the visitor.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Your customer can’t find what they want quick enough on your website</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This could be because you are trying to get them to act to too many calls-to-action or they can’t find anything clear to act on. You can fix this easily.</p>
<ol>
<li> the navigation might be using silly names to describe pages so it’s not clear where to go – change to simple descriptions</li>
<li> you have no clear and highly visible buttons or offerings that ask the visitor to do anything. This could be CALL US, BOOK A FREE QUOTE, DOWNLOAD OUR AWESOME GUIDE, VIEW ALL SERVICES.</li>
<li> keep language simple. Using convoluted language to appear intelligent firstly comes off annoying and secondly the visitor still can’t find what you do, how you help them and what they should do next</li>
<li> no clear services within the top section of the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>The core learning here is to keep the language simple, spell out what you do, how you do it and who you help in as few words as possible. Finally include one call to action you wish the visitor to take.</p>
<p>E.g Heading: We offer Osteopathy to reduce muscle pain in sports people, elderly, pregnancy and children.<br />
Followed by a button: MAKE A BOOKING</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>The videos on your website auto-play</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There is nothing that will make your visitor leave your business website within seconds of arriving than a video that auto-plays. Today’s digital-savvy customers now prefer to be the boss; they like to choose when they wish to consume online content. A quick way to get users off your site is by blasting unwanted content at them without their consent. A follow up to this is to keep your videos to less than 2 minutes, get to the point and keep the focus on who you help, how and why with as little about you as possible. Keep the old marketing adage ‘what’s in it for me’ at the forefront.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong video is a huge strategy to keep people on your site. Video will also help develop a connection with your visitor quicker than words, keep it short, show your personality and focus on solving their problems. Video testimonials are also extremely powerful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Add your customer testimonials for credibility</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>63% of customers will more likely to purchase from a site with reviews. (see full report <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/9366-ecommerce-consumer-reviews-why-you-need-them-and-how-to-use-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here )</a><br />
Use testimonials for social proof, overcoming barriers to purchase, shows real experience of working with you. Testimonials have bonus benefits as search engine spiders like fresh new content and a review is a great and easy way to fee the spiders. If you would like a testimonial template to get incredible praise for your work from customers try ours <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/testimonial-template-freebie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, it&#8217;s FREE!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, there we have 5 tips to help you keep your visitors on your site and converting more of them.  The good news is that you are getting traffic so high five for that, but now is the time to see how you can improve conversions and hopefully we &#8216;ve given you a couple of fixes to answer your question why aren&#8217;t people staying on my website that you can enact yourself.</p>
