			<p>When we create an engaging and captivating website that attracts perfect match customers, images are a huge part of the process. I thought the best way share the importance of the right images is to talk to a professional photographer.</p>
<p>This is part 1 of a 3 part series about select images for your website when you are designing a successful marketing website tool.</p>
<p>Let me introduce Fi Mims from Fi Mims Photography branding photographer, based in Melbourne, Australia. Fi is out go-to photographer for our clients and after reading this interview you will understand why! She is passionate, creative, a joy to work with, and gets results every time.</p>
<p>See some of her images below for her clients and also our clients. We encourage clients to get not just a branding image but also make their services stand out by using images of them at work. It is a very easy way to stand out from your competitors and to connect with a website visitor.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<ol>
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">Fear or anxiety can seriously ruin a shoot. Most people will let their anxiety come through in their expression, how do you help eliminate this as the images you take are always so beautiful?</li>
</ol>
<p>As the photographer my first responsibility is to make sure the person in front of my camera is comfortable, and I think this is something you just get better at with time. If someone is nervous I’ll talk to them and ask them questions – about their work, their family, their recent holiday. I pick topics I think will either distract them from the camera, or light them up and put a sparkle in their eye! And if all else fails I tell silly jokes</p>
<p>The other important thing I do is help my clients arrive at their shoot feeling prepared. To do this I send them questionnaires and pre-session guides. In many cases we also talk at length on the phone so I can answer questions or respond to any fears they have around the shoot – common ones are what to wear, what to bring. I expect clients to arrive nervous, but if they can also arrive feeling like they are as prepared as possible then that’s half my job done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">Is there a go to pose people can practise at home before coming to a shoot? Do you even recommend this, I mean should someone practice their poses or expressions before the shoot at all?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it’s a good idea to know how you want to come across in your photos. If my clients have seen images they love I encourage them to share these with me via an inspiration board on Pinterest, as that way I can use them as a guide to capture the look or feel they want to achieve. But when it comes to posing I think it’s best to leave this up to your photographer on the day – after all, that’s one of the reasons why you hired them! Your photographer should have the skill to pose you in a way that is flattering, and to bring our your natural expressions. Poses or positions that feel comfortable may not always look great through the perspective of the camera lens, so just relax and let your photographer guide you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What is your top tip to rock any photoshoot even for those people that hate having their photo taken?</li>
</ol>
<p>My one tip would probably be to book a professional hair and makeup artist, because stepping in front of the camera knowing you look amazing will help your confidence enormously. I see this all the time with my clients! I work with a great team of professional makeup artists who will meet women at the studio before their session upon request. Not only do they make them look and feel great, but it also gives them an hour to relax and just be calm before their session – it’s such a great way to walk into a shoot and the women that do it, love it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What should someone bring to a photoshoot?</li>
</ol>
<p>Plenty of outfit options so we can pick and choose what works best on the day, props relevant to their brand if they want to include these, and a clear idea of what they want to achieve through their images. And a sense of fun! You have nothing to lose when you step in front of the camera, so just enjoy yourself and relax as much as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">Would you recommend a stylist to come to a shoot?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the more you can invest in your session the better. So if you think you would benefit from either working with a stylist before your session, or having one on hand during the shoot, then go for it. More and more of my clients are working with personal stylists before their session to help them select what to wear, and the result is always great. What you wear is an important element to any image, and my clients struggle with this more than anything else. Those that work with stylists before their photo shoot always arrive feeling more confident because they don’t have to worry about how they look.</p>
<p>You really just have to assess what you want from your session and decide whether a stylist will be a worthwhile investment, or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What is the difference between a headshot and a branding portrait?</li>
</ol>
<p>A headshot is a photo of someone that focuses on their face, and is cropped to just include their head and shoulders. It’s an image so people know what you look like. A branding portrait is much more than this. A branding portrait should tell a story. It should communicate a person’s personality and their brand, and help customers connect with them. In today’s competitive market, branding portraits are a great way to stand out and make sure you get noticed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What’s the #1 mistake you see women entrepreneurs (or men) make with their photography? (This is my way of asking what really chaps your a** when it comes to photography you see online!)</li>
</ol>
<p>I suppose I get most frustrated when I see people using poor quality images over professional photography. How are people supposed to take your brand seriously when you don’t? I also get disappointed when I see stock photography used to represent brands that would be so much better represented by authentic images that show the business owner and what they do. Professional photography is an investment, but it doesn’t have to be a huge one. And when you think of the value it can offer to a business in terms of lifting its brand profile, communicating a message and attracting the right customers, there is no question as to whether or not it’s a worthwhile one.</p>
<p>People are visual beings, and we only have a few seconds to grab their attention and impress them, so great images are the best investment you can make in yourself and your business!</p>
