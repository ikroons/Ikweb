			<p>Small businesses are looking for ways to implement new business models ahead of complete lockdown. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has tipped every Australian small business into unknown territory where continuing to exist has become a daily challenge.</p>
<p>The decisions taken by our State and Federal Governments to flatten the curve as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads around the world have been particularly rough on small business owners who have been told to shut their doors. This includes hospitality businesses, entertainment and major sports events, sports, play centres, swimming pools, gyms and fitness classes. It also extends to beauty therapy, tanning, massage and tattoo parlour operators.</p>
<p>The lifeline to many small businesses will be working out how to pivot to generate income. For those that don’t have an online shop, transition to an online offering quickly will help you keep your revenue going. Read <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/helpful-ecommerce-related-articles-from-confetti-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> how to go about this.</p>
<p>Here are some great examples of what businesses have done to continue to trade:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Food service industry</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-13489 aligncenter" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog.jpg" alt="Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog" width="1099" height="630" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog.jpg 1099w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-300x172.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-768x440.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1099px) 100vw, 1099px" /></p>
<p>Many restaurants and café’s that have had to close down the dine-in option but added their menu to Uber Eats to keep trading.  Uber Eats does take 30% of your revenue so having the ordering functionality through your website will earn you more. They have however agreed, due to public pressure, for restaurants to receive daily payments rather than once a week during the pandemic, and will scrap service fees on pick-up orders until 30 June.</p>
<p>Some business who have done this are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Attica </strong>&#8211; Beautiful meals delivered and wine selected by the head Somillier<br />
<a href="https://www.attica.com.au/delivery">https://www.attica.com.au/delivery</a></li>
<li>Wineries and cellar doors are begin to offer live wine tastings. <strong>WA Printhie Wines,</strong> Wine maker, Ed Swift view is &#8220;You can&#8217;t expect to keep operating in the same manner at a time like this, so we want to transfer our face-to-face cellar door experience to a safe online experience.”</li>
<li><strong>Relish Mama</strong> – Known in Bayside for the amazing cooking classes Nellie Kerrison has been running for years has added Ready-made meals to her offering as in person classes are now cancelled. Fresh or frozen and pick up or delivery. She is also looking at adding virtual cooking classes. <a href="https://relishmama.com.au/homemade-ready-made-meals/">https://relishmama.com.au/homemade-ready-made-meals/</a></li>
<li><strong>Scicluna’s</strong> is a fresh fruit and vegetable market and is now offering Grab &amp; Go boxes, either pick up or delivery from multiple locations. 3 ready packed boxes available. <a href="https://sciclunas.com.au/sciclunas-grab-go">https://sciclunas.com.au/sciclunas-grab-go</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Most retail stores have an online presence already, the challenge now is to get found. If they don’t, now is the perfect time to add that revenue stream.<br />
Many local government councils are offering grants to finance this upgrade to your website.<br />
Check out the links below.</p>
<p>If your website doesn’t rank in Google you really need to consider Google Shopping or Google Ads to ensure your products get found. Consider adding these costs into any funding requests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Creative industries</strong></h2>
<p>The creatives industry includes artists, writers, hairdressers and beauticians.</p>
<p>Facebook is currently filled with businesses pivoting however it’s hard to find these services.</p>
<p>Some interesting ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>School holiday activities &#8211; virtual online art or writing classes</li>
<li>Artists can also apply to have an e-commerce facility added to their website – see here for details</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Fitness and Sports clubs</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Travel / Real Estate Industry</strong></h2>
<p>Local real estate agents Nick Johnstone have gone virtual. View the new wave in home selling in their video. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simone-chin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simone Chin </a> is an Licensed Estate Agent &amp; Auctioneer passionate about property and these social distancing constraints are not slowing her down! <a href="http://See the new way of buying and selling HERE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://vimeo.com/402855807</a></p>
<p>Turning luxury homes into safe holiday destinations, such as <a href="https://luxico.com.au/corporate-relocations-fully-furnished-executive-rentals/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw1Iv0BRDaARIsAGTWD1vzL5h3eRb1sKsUyF6NirQXU093wzyKJnN4_r3DA8GfLnI38KZi-YwaAoCiEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luxico</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Big Business</strong></h2>
<p>Small businesses aren&#8217;t the only ones adapting. With most large corporates all working virtually, there will be a need to maintain the culture and momentum regardless of staff location. Traditionally you would invest in team building exercises or events. Now Virtual Team Building is available and what a great initiative.<br />
In America a great new business in this area is Virtual Camp-fire nights. Although quite American the creativity is fantastic. This company&#8217;s offering includes “historic ghost stories, icebreaker questions, small competitions, and real s’mores.”</p>
<p><a href="https://teambuilding.com/events/tiny-campfire">https://teambuilding.com/events/tiny-campfire</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Resources</strong></h2>
<p>A range of <a href="https://www.myob.com/au/blog/covid-19-goverment-support-for-businesses/">stimulus packages at both State and Federal levels are being rolled out</a>. Keep an eye on the news to ensure you keep up to date with what you’re entitled to. In particular is the City of Melbournes investment into retailers who have been hit hard. View the grant details <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/melbourne-city-council-grants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
<p>A number of financial institutions have also offered interest freezes and discounts, so be sure to check what you can take advantage of with your own providers. Most banks are offering great terms to support business in this period.</p>

			<h2>We’ve probably heard the term “clear your cache” when we talk to an online support person or a tech support agent, but what does clearing your cache mean?</h2>
<p>Caches are computers’ or smart phones’ temporary storage location for the files being downloaded by your browser when you visit a website. This is for you to see the website as how it was made to be seen—your computer and mobile device store the graphics, CSS, multimedia content, and html files. Saving these files allows your computer or smart phone to “remember” the website’s content so that when you go to that page again, it will load quickly as they don’t need to re-download these files. Hence, clearing your cache is deleting all those files stored by your browser. When you clear your cache, you will see the most updated version of the website you’re viewing as your browser will fetch and download the most updated files to your device rather than referring to the old files it previously saved.</p>
<p>You should regularly clear your cache for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The saved files on your computer and mobile device accumulate space overtime and may affect your device’s performance. Clearing your cache can prevent slow loading of your browser.</li>
<li>More importantly, if you are using a shared device, clearing your cache can prevent other users from seeing the websites you’ve browsed, like websites that need passwords and you’re automatically logged in as your passwords are saved on these sites.</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Here are the steps on how to clear your cache.</h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Desktop/ Laptop: Google Chrome</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First Method</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Click on the 3-dot menu on your browser’s upper right corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12897" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/01.jpg" alt="chrome-3-dot-menu" width="702" height="240" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/01.jpg 1427w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/01-300x103.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/01-768x263.jpg 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/01-1024x350.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Select &#8216;Settings.&#8217;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12898" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/02.jpg" alt="chrome-settings-confetti-design" width="702" height="324" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/02.jpg 1351w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/02-300x138.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/02-768x354.jpg 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/02-1024x472.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will open a new window and will show your Google Chrome settings.</p>
<p>Step 3: Scroll at the bottom of page and click on &#8216;Advanced.&#8217;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12899" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03.jpg" alt="chrome-advanced-settings-confetti-design" width="701" height="478" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03.jpg 1331w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03-300x204.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03-768x523.jpg 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03-1024x698.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Desktop/Laptop: Internet Explorer</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First Method</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Click on the 3-dot menu on the upper right corner of your browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12931" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/35.jpg" alt="internet-explorer-3-dot-menu-confetti-design" width="700" height="409" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/35.jpg 1287w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/35-300x176.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/35-768x449.jpg 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/35-1024x599.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Click on ‘Settings.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12932" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/36.jpg" alt="internet-explorer-settings-confetti-design" width="700" height="446" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/36.jpg 1269w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/36-300x191.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/36-768x490.jpg 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/36-1024x653.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: You will see on the fly-out menu some of the settings options. Click on the ‘Choose what to clear’ button just below ‘Clear browsing data’ title.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12933" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/37.jpg" alt="choose-what-to-clear-internet-explorer-confetti-design" width="701" height="545" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/37.jpg 1281w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/37-300x233.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/37-768x598.jpg 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/37-1024x797.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4: The page will show your options on which data to clear aside from cached data, such as browsing history, cookies, download history, etc. You can choose them by ticking on the checkbox on their left. Afterwards, click on ‘Clear.’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4></h4>
<p><strong>Second Method</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shortcut Key: Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete simultaneously while on Internet Explorer to get to this page instantly:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-12935" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/39.jpg" alt="shortcut-key-internet-explorer-confetti-design" width="701" height="385" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/39.jpg 1655w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/39-300x165.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/39-768x422.jpg 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/39-1024x562.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can then clear your cache as we did in the last step of the first method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearing your cache isn’t as complicated as it sounds, and it will definitely help your computer or mobile device to perform faster. Make it a habit to clear your cache everyday as this doesn’t happen automatically.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have put together five main reasons why your e-commerce website needs a blog.</p>
<p>A lot of things should be considered when maintaining a high performing e-commerce website. One important element you must consider is creating and maintaining a blog. A place to share articles, tips, resources or how to videos. Basically any kind of content to add value to your customers.  Fresh regular content helps your website remain relevant,  allowing you to build your brand voice and increase awareness of you and your products.</p>
<h2><strong><br />
1. Search Engine Optimisation</strong></h2>
<p>A well written blog ensures that there is educative content that can be indexed by search engines. It ultimately helps your online store be more searchable by related topics, hence generating more visitors to your site.</p>
<p>Blogs help enhance the quality of SEO since it points appropriate answers of customer inquiries to your website. Blog posts that use quality SEO tactics such as targeting relevant keywords, placing them strategically on titles, and writing appropriate meta data descriptions give your e-commerce site the opportunity to rank in search engines—and this is always good for business! If this term is sounding foreign, read <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/seo-services-melbourne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our SEO services </a> to help understand it more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>2. Increase Traffic on your Website</strong></h2>
<p>As a business owner, your goal is to pique the interest of your target market, so that they will visit your site and increase your chances of making a sale. Posting your blog links in social media increases your chances to accomplish that goal.</p>
<p>Create a blog which is catchy, informative, and up to date. Posting these blog links in your store’s social media accounts will serve as an ad for your website. Depending on how useful your blogs are to the readers, the blog link will generate clicks and drive visitors /  traffic to your website, which is a big step towards increasing your sales!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. Brand Identity</strong></h2>
<p>There are numerous steps into starting up your brand identity. You’ll have to think about your niche, your market, a catchy <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/how-to-name-small-business/">brand name</a>, and most especially—building your brand identity.</p>
<p>When you think about a product, a specific brand usually comes to mind. For example, when thinking about carbonated drinks or soft drinks, you’ll probably think about Coca Cola. Or when thinking about toothpaste, you’ll immediately think about Colgate. These brands established their identity throughout the years by executing effective marketing strategies, which helped them gain the trust and loyalty of their customers. Same can be done with e-commerce websites. A blog is another tool to use in establishing your identity in a world full of rival brands and similar products.</p>
<p>Blogging provides a voice to your business.  You can use it to build your business’s unique personality which separates you from your competitors. Things to consider are what do you want to be known for that are also important to your customer? How can you give personality and life to your brand through your writing?  Your initial blogs could include answers to the basic identity questions: 1- who are you, and 2- what value your product or service gives to your customers. These will be ingrained in your readers’ minds as you write more and more articles on your website. In time, your readers may become your customers and eventually, your brand ambassadors!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>4. Build an Online Community</strong></h2>
<p>If you keep posting helpful and relative blogs consistently, your community of readers which are originally your searchers will keep going back to your site for new information. The comments that your viewers leave in your blog will spark a meaningful conversation with like minded people about the topics.</p>
<p>Blogs that are personalized and relatable are the ones readers usually react to. Make your blogging as inclusive and interactive as possible, specially when you are trying to build a community of brand supporters. Write about how your product contributes or solves a problem in their life. Encourage comments and conversations within your blog as these will also help in making your blog rank higher in related topics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5. Enhance Your Writing Skills</strong></h2>
<p>As important as having including a blog in your e-commerce website is, making sure your content is relevant and easy to read it also vital. Writing them doesn’t just keep you well connected to your business and your brand, but also helps develop your communication skills.</p>
<p>Here are some factors to consider when you are starting to write a blog for your online store:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your relevance. </strong>If not talking about products or services you offer, your blog should always have a connection to what your online store is offering.</li>
<li><strong>Your audience. </strong>Some blog writers are so used to using technical terms that they forget to consider who the target audience is. Basic rule is to make sure your writing style is conversational and simple. A common standard is aim for it to be understood by a high schooler! Writing like the way you talk is often a great start. Ultimately the goal is to engage your target audience so they stay on your site for longer.</li>
<li><strong>Your structure. </strong>Keep a structure which allows your audience to fully digest your blog content. The basic structure of a blog is 1-having an introduction of the topic, 2- giving more details about the topic and sub topics, and finally, summarising the main message of your blog. Structure using a hierarchy of information is also important for ranking. Google is more likely to rank your articles if they are structures logically.</li>
<li><strong>Your consistency</strong>. Decide on whether you will write a blog on a weekly or a monthly basis. This will not only help you rank higher in search engines—it will also keep your customers informed of the current trends and news about your business. This will gain more engagement to your current and future customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The e-commerce world is growing rapidly, hence the continued importance of having a blog for your website. You may start with simple blogs and then later evolve to longer ones and don&#8217;t forget you can also include video, images or infographics. What is important though is you start now and reap its benefits not only for your online store but also to your ranking. With all these gains (and nothing to lose), why don’t you start blogging now?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As a design agency we observe that an online store really needs to be starting their marketing as early as possible to build a following or audience to then launch to.  So many times people are eager to spend $1000's of dollars on the store but only to find when they launch there are crickets, no sales and marketing is hard work. </p>

			<p>Launching any business is full of tasks but to launch an e-commerce business is that much harder as there are more details to be considered.</p>
<p>These include inventory, product descriptions, refund policies, shipping, offers, customer service, great product photography, packaging, abandoned cart communications, up-selling to name a few,.</p>
<p>Not being prepared is a recipe for disaster which is why I’ve used all our client experiences to create a 7-point list to help you consider the marketing launch side of your new online store.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>1. Prepare Your Social Networks&#8230;..</strong></strong></h2>

<h6>PIC: from one of our clients who has an amazing brand aligned Instagram page. Sarah links the promotions with her products and time of the year very successfully. Her feed is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stateofelliott/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and her online store is <a href="https://stateofelliott.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Secure your social handles
<ul>
<li>This is really important from a brand perspective and ideally you would do this when you have registered your domain name and business name. You do not want it to be different as that makes life confusing for your customers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose the right platform
<ul>
<li>Your product and audience will determine the best social platform for you. Consider where your target market hangs out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up your profile with great pics
<ul>
<li>Use your brand guidelines and keep it consistent.</li>
<li>Where possible get professional photo’s taken to make a great first impression</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a content calendar plan
<ul>
<li>Mapping out your themes for posting will help with content creation and your feed will look fabulous from a brand perspective. Consistency is a great way to build followers and trust.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Link the tracking codes to your website so you monitor which performs the best</li>
<li>Consider which to integrate as an additional sales channel. You may wish to test one first or all at once. Each platform has a slightly different audience so best to create a strategy for each. Could be less burdensome to test the best one first, track effectiveness before launching into a second. (see our links below to our trusted suppliers if you wish to outsource this task)</li>
<li>We often observe, very importantly that you need to start your marketing as early as possible to build a pre-launch audience.  Using Social is a very cost effective way to do this. Blogging and sharing your &#8216;brand&#8217; voice and value to gain a following is highly beneficial so that when you launch you have an audience watching.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>2. Get Your Email Marketing Ready&#8230;.. </strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1871" height="1238" class="wp-image-12345" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/active-campaign-email-marketing-crm-ecommerce-online-stores.png" alt="active-campaign-email-marketing-crm-ecommerce-online-stores" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/active-campaign-email-marketing-crm-ecommerce-online-stores.png 1871w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/active-campaign-email-marketing-crm-ecommerce-online-stores-300x199.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/active-campaign-email-marketing-crm-ecommerce-online-stores-768x508.png 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/active-campaign-email-marketing-crm-ecommerce-online-stores-1024x678.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1871px) 100vw, 1871px" /></figure>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Choose your email provider<br />There are many providers out there that have free accounts with basics. Here are a few, some free and some paid:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mailchimp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.activecampaign.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Campaign</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.constantcontact.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constant Contact</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.getresponse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Response</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design email communications and a newsletter template
<ul>
<li>Think about the audience and what they really want to know. A newsletter is not about selling products directly, tell stories, build trust, solve problems while also promoting offers</li>
<li>Plan your calendar
<ol type="a">
<li>Create a range of topics to share that coincide with what is relevant to your target audience life, in the news, relates to times of the year. I’ve made a full list of some dates for you <a href="/e-commerce-calendar/">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Consider the customer process emails, what they look like and content to make you stand out. These can be automated and can include:
<ol type="a">
<li>Welcome series</li>
<li>E-receipts</li>
<li>Abandoned cart notifications</li>
<li>Order confirmation</li>
<li>Shipping notifications</li>
<li>Order review request</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. Install Analytics&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>Analytics are important to set up from day one. This data will give you valuable insight into your visitors and customers, their activity on your site and what is working well and what needs improvement.</p>
<p>If you use Shopify as your online store platform it has its own set of analytics reporting built in, but we suggest you also install <a href="https://www.shopify.com.au/blog/14681601-google-analytics-for-ecommerce-a-beginners-guide">Google Analytics</a>. There are plenty of other options in the market but Google Analytics is one of the most well-known and popular analytics tools.<br /><a id="keyword"></a></p>

<h2><strong>4. Do Your Keyword Research&#8230;..</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1487" height="861" class="wp-image-12400" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool.png" alt="launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool.png 1487w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-300x174.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-768x445.png 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-1024x593.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1487px) 100vw, 1487px" /></figure>
<p>The preparation for this task is all around what do you want to be found for? Another way to consider prepping your site and product pages is to answer this question What will your customer be using as the phrases or key words in Google to find your products? You can also use the search bar in Google that predicts what you are searching for as broad guessing but for accurate data you will need a Google Adwords account. Within the dashboard once logged in (top nav Tools) you can use the Keyword Planner to find exact statistics on what phrases people are using to find your products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>If you use Shopify as your online store platform it has its own SEO fields at the bottom of each product page to be completed. If you use WordPress / Woo Commerce you will need to add an SEO plugin such as Yoast, it one of the most well-known and popular SEO tools.</li>
<li>Check Page Titles
<ul>
<li>Check that page titles are appropriate and optimised for search. They should include key terms and be formatted correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check Meta Descriptions
<ul>
<li>Ensure that all media elements on your site such as your page images or product images have meta descriptions and titles. These should be relevant to your content and descriptive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check URLs
<ul>
<li>Check that all of your URLs are simple and relevant to the page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5. Decide Your KPI&#8217;s&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Starting a business it is important to know your numbers. Such as:
<ul>
<li>How much does my product cost, per unit, landed to customer front door?</li>
<li>What are the true shipping costs. This means you need to include, all fulfillment components, such as staff related picking and packing costs, software, postage, packaging etc.?</li>
<li>What are your merchant processing fees?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set yourself very specific revenue goals, down to daily numbers, this helps you understand what activity you need to do to achieve the sales goals and will help with testing what sales tactics, channels work more successfully. Your product may have an expiration date, so moving product by set dates will be vital. You don’t want to be stuck with unsellable inventory.</li>
<li>Look for ways to cut costs, as your sales volume increases you maybe able to negotiate raw material bulk discounts or better shipping rates.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>6. Know Your Shipping Strategy&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="752" class="wp-image-12404" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-1024x752.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-1024x752.jpg 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-300x220.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-768x564.jpg 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Online Store Packaging
<ul>
<li>Unboxing has become an opportunity to surprise and delight your customer, an opportunity to make a great first impression. A UK packaging company did a survey and found that 20% of packaging was not a good fit for the product, and 15% used too much packaging. Also 7% of products arrived damaged as a result of inappropriate packaging. This is a vital part of your launch. Some other useful information from this survey to help you with your online store packaging is:
<ol type="a">
<li>appropriateness of outer packaging size</li>
<li>durability of packaging</li>
<li>ease of opening</li>
<li>amount of packaging materials used</li>
<li>recyclability of packaging</li>
<li>ability to use packaging for returns</li>
<li>use of branding</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shipping options
<ul>
<li>Make shipping as easy as possible with a couple of options that make the customers life easier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shipping costs and times
<ul>
<li>Be clear about these so that you manage a customers expectations, including tracking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>7. Finalise the Launch promotion&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Running a giveaway is a great launch marketing tactic to get traffic and subscribers quickly. Giveaways have the added benefit of increasing your brand presence and product visibility especially when launching. Building an email list gives you a group of warm leads to work with, making the sales process much easier. Your first product reviews will be useful for many platforms so the more of these you get while in the early days the better.</li>
<li>You can provide first-time visitors with a discount coupon or voucher when they first land to use at checkout consumers can help boost sales.</li>
<li>Create a plan that includes your chosen social platform.</li>
<li>Get media
<ul>
<li>You may have an opportunity to get media depending on your personal story and how it relates to the launch of your product.</li>
<li>It could be beneficial to delay your launch or speed it up to leverage off what is topical or in the news.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plan the launch and first impressions.
<ul>
<li>You only get to launch once so make it count; first sales, first customer interactions, first social engagement, these all count.</li>
<li>Prepare for mistakes as things will not go to plan! This can include a ‘make good’ message / gift or a clever ‘404’ page on your website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Affiliates / Partners
<ul>
<li>You can investigate partner and affiliate marketing to boost your brand presence by offering affiliate marketing options and partnering with other online retailers.</li>
<li>You can offer bloggers who share your target audience a free sample of your product in exchange for reviews. If you’re selling products on Amazon, one easy way to gain consumer respect and confidence (and reviews) is to ask for feedback. Include a card with each product that asks for an honest review and provides contact information for your company</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Our Bayside Website Designer Explains How to Design the best website for your business.</strong></h1>
<p>Designing a website can seem simple! We want a website to convert, to be a 24/7 sales tool for your business. However, there are core steps that are missed from the outset that decrease the conversion rates for websites when visitors land. In this post, we run through the 7 steps our Bayside website designer, Johannah Barton, uses with every new client’s website project to help convert visitor traffic and it will outline how to design the best website for your small business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The 7 steps on how to design the best website and to convert visitor website traffic are:-</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a project plan</li>
<li>Choose your website builder platform(content management system)</li>
<li>Determine your keywords for site optimisation</li>
<li>Homepage: decide on layout and menu navigation</li>
<li>What is your colour scheme and image tone</li>
<li>Create your content keeping in mind your keywords</li>
<li>Test, publish and update</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 &#8211; </strong><strong>Create a plan</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Get out a pen and paper and begin answering these 5 questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Who is your site for?</li>
</ol>
<p>Think about your future audience and your business goals. The more niche or specific you are about your target audience the easier it is to connect with them. What is important to them so you can speak to those barriers or dreams. Also if you wish to get found at all on Google and use your site as a tool you MUST consider search engine optimisation or SEO. More about this in step 3.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What are your services / product? What will your target market want to find on your homepage in order to know that you can help them?</li>
<li>What would you like your business brand to communicate via this website?</li>
<li>What action do you wish them to take as a result of landing on your site?</li>
<li>What kind of features do you need in your website? Does it need a checkout cart or private locked area for customers only?</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your site should reflect the answers to these questions. For example, if your customer is older and more conservative in their outlook and values, then you will need a formal and professional site, using more subdued colours and images that convey trust, professionalism and maturity.</p>
<p>Going through this process ensures you design for your customer as well as your product and your tastes. Take some time to also investigate what your competitors are doing. Johannah will research her client’s industries locally and overseas to see what not to do. These are shared with clients to gauge what they like and don’t like to help narrow the design direction.</p>
<p>We must know where we wish to end up in order to build the path. Johannah always suggests her customers think about where they hope their business will be in 3 -5 years and design for that point.  Stretch yourself in terms of goals and target market so once you launch you begin to attract the type of business or customer you want more of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2 &#8211; </strong><strong>Choose your website builder platform.</strong></h3>
<p>One of the many reasons why you plan your website first is so you understand what features your small business website platform must be able to deliver.</p>
<p><strong>For example consider some of these features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>do you care if the platform shows their ads on the top and bottom of your website?</li>
<li>do you want to blog as a strategy to improve your Google ranks and traffic to your site?</li>
<li>do you care If you are stuck on their platform forever?</li>
<li>do you need to integrate with 3<sup>rd</sup>party applications or have an e-commerce facility?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The main options available are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>WordPress (by far our preferred platform that you can fully own as a business asset, customiseable, grows with you, unlimited features)</li>
<li>Squarespace (limited restrictions on 3<sup>rd</sup>party aps and forever on their platform, not easily customisable)</li>
<li>WIX (is cheap but you are stuck on their platform and limited by their features and the SEO is questionable)</li>
<li>Webbly (is cheap but you are stuck on their platform and limited by their features. Also charge you 3% on every purchase made if you have an ecommerce facility)</li>
<li>Go Daddy (limited functionality and customising, forever on their platform, not your business asset)</li>
<li>Custom made websites typically sit within the developers CMS, meaning you will be with your developer for the duration of the websites life</li>

<h3><strong>Step 3 &#8211; </strong><strong>Determine your keywords for your small business website optimisation</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Hearing someone say SEO, search engine optimisation, keywords, google traffic can make your eyes roll back in your head! </strong></p>
<p>In a nutshell what we are saying at this point is <strong>On-page SEO,</strong> or &#8220;saying something to a search engine,&#8221;. Meaning optimising your individual website pages so that they rank higher on search engine results pages. It is one of the most important tasks while designing your site and will save you much time and confusion once your site is built if you focus on your small business website optimisation now.</p>
<p>Before you put your head under the doona and hide, think of it like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your customer searching for in Google in order to find your services? Put yourself in the shoes of your target audiences.</li>
<li>What types of topics would your target audience search that you&#8217;d want your business to get found for?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This practise is called keyword research<br />
</strong>Keyword research helps you come up with and narrow down a list of terms you should be including in your navigation, website copy and ultimately is what is site optimisation. You use the Keyword Planner tool that sits in the dashboard of a Google Adwords account. When you go to write your headlines and copy you can then include these phrases in the heading tags and content. These phrases can also help you when you are writing blogs once you go live with your website. The expression ‘content is king’ still rules because it is what will get your website ranking higher and moving upwards to position 1 for keyword phrases.</p>
<p><strong>Once the site is built<br />
</strong>Regardless of which platform you choose to build your website on you will also include these phrases into the SEO ad-on app. In WordPress the most widely used plugin is the Yoast SEO Plugin, it will show at the bottom of each page and you will want to complete the plugin for each allocated phrase you selected, for that page.  This is why it is important to do this now before you begin writing, even the URL&#8217;s need to be planned!</p>
<p>Refer to our blog <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/how-to-complete-the-yoast-seo-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> about completing the Yoast Plugin</p>
<p>This is a specialised service and you certainly can give it a whirl, but if you want to get the most out of your website once it goes live, and attract as much Google love as you can, talk to us about our SEO partners and our small business website search engine optimisation services.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 4 &#8211; </strong><strong>Homepage: decide on layout and menu navigation</strong></h3>
<p>Once you’ve picked your website-building platform, it’s time to focus on your navigation and layout. This is the first creative step of how to design the best website. An easy way to think of it is that your homepage is like your shop window, and you only get one opportunity to make a great first impression.</p>
<p>The best website for your business will inspire a visitor to take the action you set out as your goal in your plan. If you refer back to your plan you know that there is a target audience, a service or product they have come looking for and a type of provider that will trust or will suit them.</p>
<p>We’ll now cover two aspects of the homepage: the layout and menu navigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Homepage layout</strong></p>
<p>On a simple level, a homepage has two parts: above and below the fold. Above the fold is before you scroll down and below is what follows after the visitor has scrolled. Needless to say, you want all the core messaging above the fold so if the visitor doesn’t scroll they can answer the following three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do you do?</li>
<li>Can you help me?</li>
<li>How can you help me better than the other website I’ve just been to?</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, on the banner or as close to the top of the page when you land, should be one sentence summarising the value your site adds, to whom and a bold call to action, what you want them to do. You can also include your services and benefits of using you before the visitor has to scroll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Next let’s look at what goes below the fold or after you scroll.<br />
</strong>This can contain more in-depth content that provides details about you as the business, social proofing of testimonials or client logos, case studies or videos.</p>
<p>Keep the page concise and shorter rather than longer. This is substantiated by conversion analysis software such as Crazy Egg. The heat map, click analysis and recordings of visitors behaviour on sites shows them not going much further past one scroll after the fold. As such keep all the important information as close to the fold as possible.  Less is more applies. A way to deal with the extra, more in-depth content, can be to put that onto another page. This also offers you an opportunity to add more relevant keyword search phrases to your website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Homepage navigation </strong></p>
<p>The navigation bar is the menu visitors use to navigate your site.</p>
<p>The key to successful navigation is thinking like your customer and using the words that resonate with them and that explain what the page purpose is. For example, ‘shop large dog beds’ instead of ‘our products’. Don’t overload your visitors with too many options. This will lead to choice paralysis.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some guidelines for how to design the best website navigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only add necessary pages</li>
<li>Build categories of related pages all under a clear summary heading</li>
<li>Making sure page titles are short and clear</li>
<li>Ensure the navigation bar is easily visible</li>
<li>If there are lots of pages group the related pages together. For example have corporate information on one top navigation such as include links to Contact, About Us pages and an FAQ page and then product or service headings closer to the banner under the logo.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 5 &#8211; </strong><strong>Choose a color scheme to match your brand</strong></h3>
<p>Did you know that over 80% of online shoppers stated a key reason they buy a particular product was due to colour.(recent Kissmeteric <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/psych-101-for-your-website-the-color-factor-2011-7?IR=T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> .</p>
<p>Johannah at Confetti Design,  designs brands as well as websites so generally the brand will drive the website design. Both are designed with a core goal of communicating a message and appealing to a target audience. She explains that the colour you choose as your dominant website colour should keep these two things in mind.  In this step we’d like to help you come up with a winning color strategy for your site.</p>
<p><strong>A good color strategy involves three things:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A core colour combined it with a complimentary colour. An easy guide is if your core colour is strong chose a softer complimentary colour</li>
<li>A background colour</li>
<li>A consistent colour scheme across the site. This includes the colour palate of the images you select</li>
</ul>
<p>Now your core/dominant color should be the one you want people to remember. It will be the core colour of your logo. High-value parts of your site should be designed in your dominant color.</p>
<p>It is vital that before you launch into the website design you understand the meaning of colors.  Red, for example, evokes passion and urgency. It attracts impulsive shoppers and <em>can </em>be effective for fast food and clearance sales.  Learn what each color represents and make sure the one you choose reflects your brand and will evoke the right emotion from your customers.</p>
<p>When selecting a background colour, remember to keep this as light as possible. Think about why art gallery walls are generally white? They allow the focus to be kept on the art and in your case, not distracting from the core messaging, headlines and images.</p>
<p>Complimentary colors can be used across your site to jazz up key areas. Experiment with different colored outlines to make buttons and subtitles pop out.</p>
<p>Whatever color palette you choose, it’s very important to remain consistent.</p>
<p>Don’t have different color schemes on different pages. Your visitors will just get confused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 6 &#8211; </strong><strong>Create your content keeping in mind your customer and keywords</strong></h3>
<p>The content refers to all the words, images and fonts.  This is where the design magic happens so in this step, we’ll explain each starting with fonts.</p>
<p><strong>Font selection</strong></p>
<p>As a rule, keep it to a max of 2 fonts with a max of 2 thicknesses. The reason being is that we still want the visitor to be able to read the words and not be too distracted.</p>
<p>More importantly is keeping the fonts legible, so we are talking about cursive or script fonts. Use them for a design feature if it suits your brand but only for short words or 2-word statements for the design effect. There is no point using a ‘pretty’ font if no one can read it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Consistency Counts<br />
</strong>We talked about colour selection and keeping the usage to a few core colours and the same applies to fonts and font colours. Keep it consistent across pages, hence for all core headings use the same size font and thickness; paragraph font is always the same size and thickness.</p>
<p>You can be a bit more creative with the “call-to-action” (CTA) buttons but keep the language simple and font selection legible. Additionally, ensure the CTA button colour complements your website colour palate. It’s not just about the font, it’s also about the space between lines of text. The perfect line height is around 150% of the font size you’re using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Content<br />
</strong>There is an absolute art to writing for a website. Where possible we would advise you use a copywriter not only because they are experts but also to ensure the keywords extracted from the research in Step 3 are woven into your pages.</p>
<p>The content has to engage and speak to your audience and at the same time be succinct and eye-catching. There is nothing more likely to make a visitor bounce off your site than long sections of text, well perhaps putting long sections of white text on a dark or bright background! To make your content stand out, try surrounding it with white space and use headings to make core messages get noticed</p>
<p>Finally, make sure there are no sloppy spelling or grammar mistakes in your site’s copy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Images<br />
</strong>With less than 6 seconds to make an impression images are an easy way to connect with your visitor. Images are certainly one vital element in how to design the best website for your small business and they have the power to make your website unique and really stand out.</p>
<p>Visual content increases engagement and length of time on a site. Plus, images stick in the mind. If we hear a piece of information, we’ll only remember 10% of it; but if you add a picture, you’ll remember an incredible 65%, according to <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy">one study</a>.  You can of course overdo it and more images will slow down your website so size them correctly, and of course name them correctly so Google crawls them. An un-named image will have Google stop crawling your website.</p>

<h3><strong>Step 7 &#8211; </strong><strong>Test Publish Update</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Test<br />
</strong>Before you go live have a few key people review the site for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation clarity</li>
<li>Links click to where they should go</li>
<li>Language and spelling proofed</li>
<li>Contact forms tested</li>
<li>Check viewing on tables and phones, both IOS and Android</li>
<li>Check viewing on Chrome vs Safari vs Explorer</li>
<li>Load your Site map onto Webmaster Console</li>
<li>Link to Google Analytics</li>
<li>Set up security so your investment isn’t lost via hacking</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hit Go Live<br />
</strong>The time to publish can be nerve-wracking but if you’ve put the site through the test with a few people you can feel comfortable all is ready.</p>
<p>Share the website as much as you can get traffic to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update<br />
</strong>There are several reasons to keep updating your site. We will cover off 3 of these now.</p>
<ol>
<li>Update plugins if you use WordPress to avoid hacking</li>
<li>Update regularly and frequently with content (blogs) to keep your site fresh. This type of update tells search engines like Google your site is fresh and current. If you use your SEO keyword research to write blogs that are of interest to your target audience you are also more likely to get more suitable visitors to your site for your services.</li>
<li>Update price lists, product and contact information as you evolve and your business grows to keep you site relevant.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>In this post, I’ll go over Contact Us page best practices 2018, including the core purposes of your contact page and how you can improve your contact page.</h2>
<p>It is one of the most visited pages on your website and often the most overlooked page. When you think about it, really it should be the most considered page as it’s what you want people ultimately do right, contact you! Read on to find out what the contact us page best practices 2018 are then you can make some updates and monitor your improved conversions.</p>
<p>For many businessess, the contact page manages all incoming contact requests. Therefore you can help the user get the right information before they have to make an enquiry or guide the enquiry. This can be achieved by including popular FAQ’s or directions on how to find the business or the appropriate person in the company.</p>
<p>What works for others, might not work for your contact page. It highly depends on what kind of business you have.</p>
<h3>1. Essential elements of your contact page</h3>
<p>Think about what <em>you</em> look for when visiting a contact page. Personally, I like it when a company leaves a phone number, it shows me they are accessible. However I don’t always want to call so having a direct contact email address is a bonus. Personally I am not keen on contact forms, I have a feeling they get lost, however I do use them.</p>
<p>So I’d advise you provide everything: Contact page must-have details would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company name.</li>
<li>Company address &amp; map</li>
<li>General company phone number.</li>
<li>General company email address.</li>
<li>Contact form.</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3>2. Check your grammar:</h3>
<p>There are generally not too many words on a Contact Us page so best we choose our words carefully and ensure grammar is perfecto!</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>3. Keep it simple but relevant:</h3>
<p>A contact us page can include other information for the visitor such as a map of your location, department head contacts or specific CTA’s for a demo or tour booking over a general enquiry. Whatever it is, ensure you make it easy to find the contact form and the contact details. Keep the design simple and font big and clearly legible, not silly script fonts! Another maddening trend is to make fields mandatory or fields not relevant to your target market.  A sure-fire way to miss out on the form being completed.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>4. Why and when should I contact you?</h3>
<p>It might sound obvious, but telling your visitors why and when they should or shouldn’t contact you is really helpful. One of the most successful things you can achieve via your website pages is managing expectations.  For example you can inform people how long they may have to wait to hear back from you. Or provide a few topics of what they can contact you about via a dropdown on the contact form.<br />
Or  you could simply let them know you only take calls before 4pm each day and you reply to every message within 8 hours.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>5. Look gorgeous:</h3>
<p>When users visit your contact us page, it is the beginning of a relationship so first impressions count. Include great visuals of the team or on-brand personality-plus images to help create a good connection. You want the visitor to be keen to contact you. A bland white page with a contact form is not overly enticing.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>6. Show off your personality:</h3>
<p>Users who visit your contact us page are there to reach out to you and learn more about you. Think about how you want your copy to reflect your brand persona. If your audience is the casual, fun-loving crowd, consider a light-hearted, even comical tone for your contact us page.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>7. Provide some FAQ’s:</h3>
<p>For a larger company or if you need to be mindful of your time offering a series of commonly asked questions is a great way to filter emails. It can save time and limit the number of un-necessary emails. The contact page is simply be a great place to put FAQ’s as logically people are there to reach out for something and perhaps that something is a question you can answer immediately.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>8. Add in a virtual chat function:</h3>
<p>Many sites now have the slide-in or pop-up virtual chat facility which can be annoying but your Contact Us page can be the perfect location for this.  In our online era, many users prefer chatting online with a help agent rather than calling in person. If this sounds like your demographic then why not provide a quick and easy way to get help. Below the chat window pop some FAQ&#8217;s and other means of contact, giving users their contact method of choice.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>9. Include a compelling call-to-action:</h3>
<p>This can simply be how you design and feature the core call-to-action, such as making your phone number a clickable bright coloured button. Make sure it’s clear what you want your visitor to do on that contact page, pick your preferred contact method and make it stand out.</p>
<p>In summary take a good look with new eyes at your contact page as most are dull and boring and when they show to be one of the top 3 pages visited. Give the audience what they need and hope to see and then a bit of a surprise too!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Have you heard Google want you to switch your site to HTTPS?</h1>
<p>#updated July 2018 &#8211; this is now more important than last year and all sites need to have an HTTPS.</p>
<h3>Firstly what is HTTPS?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure</strong></span> (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The &#8216;S&#8217; at the end of HTTPS stands for &#8216;Secure&#8217;. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. So essentially an https offers a secure method for hosting your website. It’s recongnised by the padlock in the browser bar.</p>
<h3>Some background information.</h3>
<p>In 2014 Google announced in a campaign that they would start to rank secure pages over unsecure ones. 3 years later and now it’s more than just a ranking issues, Google and many others want the web to be more secure in general. If you think about it we want that too. We all know how our information is taken and stored for re-targetting and it is only going to become more invasive of our surfing activities.</p>
<p>In August 2014 Google had their HTTPS everywhere campaign, they announced HTTPS as a ranking signal.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cBhZ6S0PFCY?ecver=1" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first they noted that “for now it’s only a very lightweight signal,” but over time Google “may decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to encourage all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.” Then on Sept. 8, 2016 <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/09/moving-towards-more-secure-web.html">Google announced</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SSL-blog-turn-my-site-into-https.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4062 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SSL-blog-turn-my-site-into-https-e1488491428543.png" alt="SSL-blog-turn-my-site-into-https" width="662" height="231" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Early this year, 2017,</strong> </span>version 56 of the Chrome web browser was released. There is a significant change in the way it displays websites that are not using HTTPS, also known as holding an SSL certificate. This change may confuse your site visitors or surprise you if you are not expecting it.</p>
<p>Starting with the release of Chrome 56 in Januart, any website that is not running HTTPS will have a message appear in the location bar that says “Not Secure” on pages that collect passwords or credit cards. It will look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/not_secure.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3971" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/not_secure.png" alt="not_secure-turn-my-site-into-https" width="300" height="136" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may confuse your site visitors who land on your site or sign into it because they may interpret the message to indicate that your website has been compromised. They could also interpret the message to mean that your site has some underlying security issue other than being non-HTTPS. The initial changes will affect websites that collect login and credit card information over http but as Google rolls out their plan to secure web privacy across the internet we can be sure that change is coming soon and it is sensible to get it sorted sooner rather than later.</p>
<h3>The nitty gritty of why you should make your site an HTTPS?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong> Google identifies several reasons to switch to HTTPS in their website migration guide:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Encrypting</strong> the exchanged data to keep it secure from eavesdroppers. That means that while the user is browsing a website, nobody can “listen” to their conversations, track their activities across multiple pages or steal their information.</li>
<li><strong>Data integrity. </strong>Data cannot be modified or corrupted during transfer, intentionally or otherwise, without being detected.</li>
<li>Proves that your users communicate with the intended website. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks and builds user trust, which translates into other business benefits.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> SSL benefit to search rankings. </strong>Everyone with a business website wants to achieve strong rankings in the SERPS (search engine results pages) — but it isn’t easy. With literally hundreds of different and evolving criteria used in Google’s algorithm, you want to use every available tool to your advantage. <strong>SSL encryption can help your website rank higher in search results.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Trust: </strong>If you have contact forms on your site or need to take any information, seeing the HTTPS and green padlock will add to the trust perception and let potential contacts know their submission is protected and that you are not a fly-by-night operation. Certificate Authorities also offer <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/find-my-site-seal-code-3441">Trust Seals</a> that you can display on your site. In addition to the padlock and HTTPS in your browser location bar, these graphics give website visitors an additional visual indication that you have SSL encryption in place.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>How do you transfer from HTTP to an HTTPS?</h3>
<p>There are quite a few steps involved to move to an HTTPS, Google has a guide <u><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6073543?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</u> In essence you need to purchase an SSL Certificate, load it onto your website sever then map all the pages / images / content / links ulrs from http to https.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Feeling Overwhelmed? Want to protect your site but need help?</h3>
<p>We can take care of all the technical issues for you and just make it happen!</p>

</div>
<h3></h3>
<h3>If you like details and want to know more, here is the &#8216;how&#8217;.</h3>
<h4><span style="color: #333333;"> <span style="color: #cb0044;">Step 1 is to purchase an SSL Certificate.</span></span></h4>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Types Of SSL Certificate</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous types and brands of SSL Certificate and whilst they all work using the same principle they do offer different features.</p>
<p>Here is a high level overview:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain SSL</strong> – Most popular type of SSL. Browser Padlock shows. Domain Name only appears in browser bar. Low cost and instant issue. No paperwork, no waiting. Limited to one domain only. (The type we are offering to install)</li>
<li><strong>Wildcard SSL</strong> – Same as Domain SSL but extends to sub domains of this domain (not available on Extended SSL – see below)</li>
<li><strong>Organization SSL</strong> – More expensive SSL with domain ownership and Company verification required. Usually issued in 1 to 2 business days. Browser Padlock shows with Domain Name &amp; Company Name appearing.</li>
<li><strong>Extended SSL</strong> – Most expensive type of SSL which requires domain ownership and Company verification as well as legal, physical &amp; operational verification required. Usually issued within 3 to 4 business days. Extended validation with green browser bar showing company name.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2 Install SSL Certificate</h4>
<p>For the purpose of brevity we will assume that a Domain SSL is being purchased as you are a single person business and are concerned with the installation of the SSL and the switch to HTTPS rather than the vetting procedure of an Organization or Extended SSL.</p>
<p>Your webmaster or hosting company will then create the Certificate Signing Request and perform the installation of the certificate.</p>
<p>To install an SSL your site must have a Dedicated IP address. If your site doesn’t have a dedicated IP address you will need to change your hosting plan or host. Some hosts will do this once you start the installation process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 3 Backup Your Website</h4>
<p>As a security measure before redirecting your site to HTTPS we recommend making a full backup of your website.</p>
<p>This is an optional step and is only in case there are any issues and you need to restore your files. As a rule it is sensible to take a back-up of your site regularly.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 4 Configure Hard Links In Your Website</h4>
<p>Because you are switching from HTTP to HTTPS the internal links in your website need to reflect this otherwise they will return 404 errors (file not found).</p>
<p>If you have a small website you can do this by hand or get a Developer to make these changes.</p>
<p>However, if you have a large site maybe hundreds or even thousands of pages there are tools that can help you to do this very quickly.</p>
<p>If you use WordPress you can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/velvet-blues-update-urls/">Velvet Blues Update URLs Plugin</a> or the <a href="https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/">interconnectit – search replace php script</a>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 5 Update Tools &amp; Code Libraries</h4>
<p>This usually won’t apply unless you have a larger, more complex website.</p>
<p>If you are using different tools for your website for extra functionality such as JavaScript or Ajax then be sure to update these so that they will work when you switch to HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 6 Change Any External Links Under Your Control</h4>
<p>If you have external websites pointing to your site (i.e. backlinks) you should change any that you have under your control from HTTP to HTTPS. Mostly these will be things like directory listings.</p>
<p>Most of the time they won’t be under your control though but don’t worry about this as you will be making changes later that will redirect any HTTP traffic to HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 7 Implement 301 Redirects</h4>
<p>A 301 redirect is a permanent redirection that you can set up to tell any HTTP traffic to now go to the HTTPS equivalent.</p>
<p>If you are not an experienced Web Professional then this is probably best left to a developer.</p>
<p>Depending on your webserver you will need to setup sitewide direction.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 8 Update Links In 3rd Party Tools &amp; Transactional Emails</h4>
<p>If you’re using any third party applications such an email marketing tool, marketing automation or Customer Relationship Management tool then you’ll need to run a manual check on any links that you’ve created there to make sure they’re all up to date.</p>
<p>Likewise if you have a billing system your transactional emails such as welcome emails and any invoice emails need to be updated to reflect the change. Of course the redirection you’ve set up previously will forward any HTTP links to the HTTPS equivalent but it’s always more professional to correct these.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 9 Update Landing Pages &amp; Paid Search Links</h4>
<p>If you have any landing pages setup then these will have been updated automatically by the 301 redirect but for completeness you should double check these.</p>
<p>Also check the links you are using in the paid search tools you are using whether that’s Google, Facebook or whatever.</p>
<p>Also if you use a Landing Page generator then you should update your setting there to reflect the switch.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 10 Update Google Search Console &amp; Google Analytics</h4>
<p>Finally you need to make sure that you update your Google Search Console (Google Webmaster Tools) by submitting the new HTTPS site as well as re-submitting your SiteMap.</p>
<p>Also don’t forget Google Analytics to make sure that you can get the correct analytics. That’s just a question of setting the ‘Default URL’ to HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Wrap Up</h3>
<p>Switching to HTTPS has a few steps involved. But increasingly security is important and sooner or later you will need to make the switch.</p>
<p>Choose the right sort of SSL for your needs. There are several types and whilst they all work the same there are varying degrees of verification and also the way the browser appears, such as the green browser bar.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve tried your best to create your own website; you have labored for hours over the words to capture your visitor&#8217;s interest, you have added some pretty images. You are also getting good traffic to your website, but you wonder why most of these leads don’t convert and they leave after only a few seconds of visiting a page on your site. You will be rubbing your head asking why aren&#8217;t visitors staying on my website?</p>
<p>According to the Nielsen Norman Group, (leaders in user experience research) most users stick around less than 59 seconds. This means that if you are unable to capture your user’s attention in less than a minute, you’ve lost them. Frightening when you think of the effort already put into your small business website!</p>
<p>I’ve pulled together a few reasons why your visitors don’t stay on your website for long and what you might do to rectify the situation. Keep in mind with marketing, there is no absolute definative answer, it is a task of test and measure. Try addressing a few of these issues below then monitor the changes to behaviour in your analytics dashboard. (Just on this: if you don&#8217;t have analytics please do that first, you have invested in a website, respect that expenditure by monitoring what happens on it, who comes to it, where they come from)</p>
<p>You don’t need to do all of the suggestions below at once. And it goes without saying try the cheapest and quickest ideas first, test it out, observe results then try another idea.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your website design is not engaging or talking ‘to’ your customer</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The truth is we all judge the book by its cover, you are naive to think otherwise and losing opportunities. Design matters and clarity of message is important. Appealing to your customer is vital, if you can look at your site through their eyes is a good start.</p>
<p>If your site still looks like a design of 1992, or it’s not responding on a table or phone, then you actually do need to invest the dollars in a professional makeover design. If your site is responsive but not sure if it’s the design that is outdated or how to fix it, take advantage of a website and brand review. There are quite a few automated ones online and we also offer the service <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/website-audit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEBSITE AUDIT</a>.<br />
Benefit of a review is you get the perspective of a visitor, then you can try to fix the issues yourself before starting a complete re-design.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Your website content is difficult to read</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your design is not only about your choice of colors, graphics or images, but the colors of your text and background determine how easy your visitors can read and digest the content on your website. The simple truth is your website won’t convert well if it can’t be easily read. There are no particular fonts to use and which to avoid, however when in doubt use one font in 2 -3 sizes or thickness on light backgrounds. The next big tip is to break up all sections of copy with a hierarchy of really important summary headings, a secondary sub-heading then the body of the copy. This breaks the information into bit sized pieces for the visitor.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Your customer can’t find what they want quick enough on your website</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This could be because you are trying to get them to act to too many calls-to-action or they can’t find anything clear to act on. You can fix this easily.</p>
<ol>
<li> the navigation might be using silly names to describe pages so it’s not clear where to go – change to simple descriptions</li>
<li> you have no clear and highly visible buttons or offerings that ask the visitor to do anything. This could be CALL US, BOOK A FREE QUOTE, DOWNLOAD OUR AWESOME GUIDE, VIEW ALL SERVICES.</li>
<li> keep language simple. Using convoluted language to appear intelligent firstly comes off annoying and secondly the visitor still can’t find what you do, how you help them and what they should do next</li>
<li> no clear services within the top section of the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>The core learning here is to keep the language simple, spell out what you do, how you do it and who you help in as few words as possible. Finally include one call to action you wish the visitor to take.</p>
<p>E.g Heading: We offer Osteopathy to reduce muscle pain in sports people, elderly, pregnancy and children.<br />
Followed by a button: MAKE A BOOKING</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>The videos on your website auto-play</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There is nothing that will make your visitor leave your business website within seconds of arriving than a video that auto-plays. Today’s digital-savvy customers now prefer to be the boss; they like to choose when they wish to consume online content. A quick way to get users off your site is by blasting unwanted content at them without their consent. A follow up to this is to keep your videos to less than 2 minutes, get to the point and keep the focus on who you help, how and why with as little about you as possible. Keep the old marketing adage ‘what’s in it for me’ at the forefront.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong video is a huge strategy to keep people on your site. Video will also help develop a connection with your visitor quicker than words, keep it short, show your personality and focus on solving their problems. Video testimonials are also extremely powerful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Add your customer testimonials for credibility</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>63% of customers will more likely to purchase from a site with reviews. (see full report <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/9366-ecommerce-consumer-reviews-why-you-need-them-and-how-to-use-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here )</a><br />
Use testimonials for social proof, overcoming barriers to purchase, shows real experience of working with you. Testimonials have bonus benefits as search engine spiders like fresh new content and a review is a great and easy way to fee the spiders. If you would like a testimonial template to get incredible praise for your work from customers try ours <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/testimonial-template-freebie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, it&#8217;s FREE!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, there we have 5 tips to help you keep your visitors on your site and converting more of them.  The good news is that you are getting traffic so high five for that, but now is the time to see how you can improve conversions and hopefully we &#8216;ve given you a couple of fixes to answer your question why aren&#8217;t people staying on my website that you can enact yourself.</p>

			<p>When we create an engaging and captivating website that attracts perfect match customers, images are a huge part of the process. I thought the best way share the importance of the right images is to talk to a professional photographer.</p>
<p>This is part 1 of a 3 part series about select images for your website when you are designing a successful marketing website tool.</p>
<p>Let me introduce Fi Mims from Fi Mims Photography branding photographer, based in Melbourne, Australia. Fi is out go-to photographer for our clients and after reading this interview you will understand why! She is passionate, creative, a joy to work with, and gets results every time.</p>
<p>See some of her images below for her clients and also our clients. We encourage clients to get not just a branding image but also make their services stand out by using images of them at work. It is a very easy way to stand out from your competitors and to connect with a website visitor.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<ol>
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">Fear or anxiety can seriously ruin a shoot. Most people will let their anxiety come through in their expression, how do you help eliminate this as the images you take are always so beautiful?</li>
</ol>
<p>As the photographer my first responsibility is to make sure the person in front of my camera is comfortable, and I think this is something you just get better at with time. If someone is nervous I’ll talk to them and ask them questions – about their work, their family, their recent holiday. I pick topics I think will either distract them from the camera, or light them up and put a sparkle in their eye! And if all else fails I tell silly jokes</p>
<p>The other important thing I do is help my clients arrive at their shoot feeling prepared. To do this I send them questionnaires and pre-session guides. In many cases we also talk at length on the phone so I can answer questions or respond to any fears they have around the shoot – common ones are what to wear, what to bring. I expect clients to arrive nervous, but if they can also arrive feeling like they are as prepared as possible then that’s half my job done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li class="text-pink text-bigger">Is there a go to pose people can practise at home before coming to a shoot? Do you even recommend this, I mean should someone practice their poses or expressions before the shoot at all?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it’s a good idea to know how you want to come across in your photos. If my clients have seen images they love I encourage them to share these with me via an inspiration board on Pinterest, as that way I can use them as a guide to capture the look or feel they want to achieve. But when it comes to posing I think it’s best to leave this up to your photographer on the day – after all, that’s one of the reasons why you hired them! Your photographer should have the skill to pose you in a way that is flattering, and to bring our your natural expressions. Poses or positions that feel comfortable may not always look great through the perspective of the camera lens, so just relax and let your photographer guide you!</p>

<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What is your top tip to rock any photoshoot even for those people that hate having their photo taken?</li>
</ol>
<p>My one tip would probably be to book a professional hair and makeup artist, because stepping in front of the camera knowing you look amazing will help your confidence enormously. I see this all the time with my clients! I work with a great team of professional makeup artists who will meet women at the studio before their session upon request. Not only do they make them look and feel great, but it also gives them an hour to relax and just be calm before their session – it’s such a great way to walk into a shoot and the women that do it, love it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What should someone bring to a photoshoot?</li>
</ol>
<p>Plenty of outfit options so we can pick and choose what works best on the day, props relevant to their brand if they want to include these, and a clear idea of what they want to achieve through their images. And a sense of fun! You have nothing to lose when you step in front of the camera, so just enjoy yourself and relax as much as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">Would you recommend a stylist to come to a shoot?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the more you can invest in your session the better. So if you think you would benefit from either working with a stylist before your session, or having one on hand during the shoot, then go for it. More and more of my clients are working with personal stylists before their session to help them select what to wear, and the result is always great. What you wear is an important element to any image, and my clients struggle with this more than anything else. Those that work with stylists before their photo shoot always arrive feeling more confident because they don’t have to worry about how they look.</p>
<p>You really just have to assess what you want from your session and decide whether a stylist will be a worthwhile investment, or not.</p>

<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What is the difference between a headshot and a branding portrait?</li>
</ol>
<p>A headshot is a photo of someone that focuses on their face, and is cropped to just include their head and shoulders. It’s an image so people know what you look like. A branding portrait is much more than this. A branding portrait should tell a story. It should communicate a person’s personality and their brand, and help customers connect with them. In today’s competitive market, branding portraits are a great way to stand out and make sure you get noticed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What’s the #1 mistake you see women entrepreneurs (or men) make with their photography? (This is my way of asking what really chaps your a** when it comes to photography you see online!)</li>
</ol>
<p>I suppose I get most frustrated when I see people using poor quality images over professional photography. How are people supposed to take your brand seriously when you don’t? I also get disappointed when I see stock photography used to represent brands that would be so much better represented by authentic images that show the business owner and what they do. Professional photography is an investment, but it doesn’t have to be a huge one. And when you think of the value it can offer to a business in terms of lifting its brand profile, communicating a message and attracting the right customers, there is no question as to whether or not it’s a worthwhile one.</p>
<p>People are visual beings, and we only have a few seconds to grab their attention and impress them, so great images are the best investment you can make in yourself and your business!</p>
