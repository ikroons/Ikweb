			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have your pick of social media platforms, but for retailers the most successful and popular at the moment is Instagram. In the US 71% of businesses are on Instagram, there is no denying it is the place to be, and the visual nature of Instagram makes it likely to be the leader for a while to come.<br />
If you are not on Instagram then read up on our easy to follow steps so you start the right way. If you are already a gun on ‘the gram’ then these tips will be a good checklist to make sure you stay at the top of your game!<br />
This guide will take you through the 4 steps to starting in Instagram the right way that will make both the returns for your efforts and the on-going management so much easier.<br />
</span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 1 – Understanding your customer</strong></h3>
<p>Before you even think of creating the account, you want to get crystal clear on who your jewelry customer is. Truly understanding your target market is one of the most crucial things in running a successful business. It is only by having a clear idea in your mind of who you would like to reach, sell to or help that you can tailor and target your messages to have the strongest impact on your audience.</p>
<p>This has to be the key step that underpins your future success on Instagram. And really any marketing activity. Without it all your posting is like a scatter gun approach and the likelihood of connecting with your audience is slim.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you need to know your customer so clearly?</strong></p>
<p>1. You can create content to engage and connect with them when you have them in the forefront of your mind.<br />
2. You can ask yourself ‘will our perfect customer relate to this, be inspired to act, feel an emotional connection, be moved, feel like we ‘get them?’<br />
3. If you wish to use influencers, knowing who your customer is ensures you pick the right influencer.<br />
4. Engaging in cross promotions is easier as you look for other businesses who share the same customer.<br />
5. Although not a direct impact on your Instagram activity, knowing WHERE your customer hangs out or what they do in their life can guide your traditional marketing efforts. Local cafes to be linked with, event venues, magazines to advertise in. When you know where your customer spends their life means you can position yourself literally in their sight!</p>
<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>
<p>• What are your customer’s values? What is important to them?<br />
• What is their lifestyle? Or how do they spend their time? What is important to them?<br />
• What is their age?<br />
• Where do they live?<br />
• Is there a specific gender you serve more than another? – Who is really doing the research on your product?<br />
• What brands do they love?<br />
• Where do they eat, holiday, shop regularly?<br />
• What are their aspirations?<br />
• What magazines do they read, films watch, Netflix shows?</p>
<p><strong>The Problems</strong></p>
<p>• List all the problems you solve for your customers?<br />
• What emotions do they feel at the exact moment they discover your store and service?<br />
• What specific words and phrases are they saying to themselves or using to friends when describing how it feels to discover your service?</p>
<p><strong>The Solutions</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter whether you could realistically deliver or create these experiences, the goal is simply to unlock your imagination and challenge yourself to step into your customer’s shoes and see things in a new way. These insights will help with the type of content you create and how you try to engage your customers via Instagram.<br />
Before they found you what was their reality as it relates to buying a product like yours?<br />
• How were they trying to solve the problem?<br />
• Where were they looking to find a solution?<br />
• Who were they talking to in order to find a solution?<br />
• How was it impacting their personal life?<br />
• Have they tried other solutions before?<br />
• Why did that solution not work for them? Why are they still looking?<br />
• What do they wish Jewelers understood about them?<br />
• What is your customer’s dream? In their ideal world, what’s their ultimate fantasy of how your product or service would be delivered?<br />
• Do they have barriers to purchase from you?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions help build out a real picture of your target audience/s. Now you have this ‘persona’ or ‘ideal customer’ described it’s useful to even go to the extent of naming them, find images from magazines to visualize the perfect customers. It may be that you base this avatar on one of your best customers. In fact you could go to your most loyal customer and ask them to help answer the questions.</p>
<p>You not only have an amazing understanding of who you need to connect with via your posts, you also have a huge amount of content right in those answers. To see how we use all this fantastic insights be sure to download the guide called Instagram – Creating Content That Engages.<br />
Now we move onto the goal setting step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Set Your Goals</strong></h3>
<p>Now you have a good idea of who you want to become your brand follower, come into your store or click through to your website, you want to get your goals clear. The reason we do this is that having a clear goal or 2 or 3 goals allows you to purposefully create content and more chance of achieving the set goals.</p>
<p>Haphazardly posting is not a viable strategy when it comes to Instagram for business. Once you define who is your customer you need to define what it is your brand wants to do, then you can begin to better speak the language of your followers.</p>
<p><strong>How to Create a Social Media Goal</strong></p>
<p>Use the oldie-but-goodie SMART technique to set your goals.</p>
<p>S- <strong>Specific </strong></p>
<p>Goals should be clear and simple, but very detailed in terms of what you want to happen.</p>
<p>NOT SPECIFIC &#8211; increase our followers<br />
SPECIFIC &#8211; increase our followers by 100% by end of month August 2019</p>
<p>M- <strong>Measurable </strong></p>
<p>You will need to have a goal that you can measure, and there are a lot of social media tools that can help you measure the success of your strategy such as Instagram Insights. Ensure your website has analytics so you can track the number of new users that come from your Instagram account to specific product pages.</p>
<p>You can use a tool like Bitly.com that is a unique trackable url you can put into your bio.<br />
If you would like more reading on this..here is an article that lists 8 Instagram Analytics Tools <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/instagram-analytics-tools/">https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/instagram-analytics-tools/</a></p>
<p>A- <strong>Action Oriented </strong></p>
<p>This part is where you’ll create actionable task that will turn your goal into reality. Your “plan of attack will be detailed here as you create your goal.</p>
<p>An example of a goal is to increase the traffic to your store or online store that results in 20 new sales directly via your Instagram account in the month of August. This goal could include the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post offers that are redeemed in store or online</li>
<li>Post blogs</li>
<li>Post new products</li>
<li>Linked In-store activities – launch of a new product or a joint wedding dress fashion show with local bridal boutique in your store</li>
<li>Post snippet of a video with full length video on the website</li>
</ul>
<p>R- <strong>Realistic </strong></p>
<p>With all your resources on hand (time, money, people), is the goal you’re setting realistic? This is what you need to keep in mind when creating your goal. This is where you may reduce your goal or look to outsource some tasks to achieve the goals.</p>
<p>T- <strong>Time Bound </strong></p>
<p>Every goal needs a deadline, otherwise it’s not a goal—it’s a wishful thinking. Keeping in mind the complexity of the actions, as well as your resources, create a time frame that is both suitable to the goal as well as realistic.</p>

			<p><strong>You can create just a few goals to avoid being overwhelmed. Some of the most common Social Media goals are: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased brand awareness</li>
<li>Drive sales through traffic to your website</li>
<li>Drive sales through traffic to your store</li>
<li>Demonstrate company culture</li>
<li>Showcase your team and recruit new talent</li>
<li>Increase customer engagement and loyalty</li>
<li>Showcase products</li>
<li>Share company or industry news</li>
<li>Build a more engaged community</li>
<li>Connect with influencers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An example in action </strong></p>
<p>Let’s look at an example of a SMART goal for Increase Brand Awareness in the next 2 months:</p>
<p><strong>Specific- </strong>Build up brand awareness of the new website within two-month period</p>
<p><strong>Measurable- </strong>Reach 1,000 traffic increase in the next month and another 1,000 the following month.</p>
<p><strong>Action Oriented &#8211; </strong>Create pre-launch content to be posted to build momentum. Encourage pre-launch sign up for a discount or advanced warning of specials. During the first week of a product launch, create a post every 2 days with calls to action to the new website, sharing reviews, new product, video’s of users with product, unboxing experiences or blog posts on related topics to the launch and product. This can include paid sponsored ads</p>
<p><strong>Realistic &#8211; </strong></p>
<p>✓ Ads Budget : 8 week period x 2.5 posts a week x $10 = $200</p>
<p>✓ Content writer and graphic designer hired to create materials</p>
<p><strong>Time Bound- </strong>2 month period with check point of 1 month</p>
<p><strong>Set Your Baseline </strong></p>
<p>It is important that before you take any actions in your social media account against this goal that you have set your starting point. This means that you have the data from an analytics point of view on where you’re currently at (traffic to your site, bounce rates, particular page visits.) so that you’ll know exactly how your statistics are improving after implementing your actions.</p>
<p><strong>Check Points </strong></p>
<p>Lastly, set up check points to review your statistics so that you’ll see which is working or not. Is the ad budget boosting enough or reaching your preferred audience? Or is brand awareness really what you should focus on? You can check the social media and google analytics that you’ve set to gauge and evaluate your efforts.</p>
<p>Now you have a goal or set of goals you need a clear strategy to achieve these. However before we embark on that we need to do the one thing that makes all of our efforts easier, understanding our customer.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Now you have a clear vision of the customer to attract and a goal or set of goals your next step is to create a social media strategy. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Let’s recap </strong>– Goal #1 &#8211; Increase Brand Awareness in next 2 months</p>
<p>It is tricky to translate your social media efforts into sales especially when you’re in a brick and mortar business. However not including a social media strategy is effectively ignoring a huge portion of the potential customers.</p>
<p>Common metrics that can be measured are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of followers</li>
<li>Number of clicks through to the website from Instagram</li>
<li>Number of sales using unique Instagram promo code</li>
<li>Number of tags on other pages</li>
<li>Number of check ins</li>
<li>Number of comments</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instagram strategies to achieve this goal could be: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build content themes to speak to a problem of target audience</li>
<li>Share products your customer loves more than any others</li>
<li>Create articles that are indirectly related to your product but your customer would find helpful. Link these articles to your website, include the products on the blogs as an indirect selling opportunity</li>
<li>Share reviews that overcome barriers your customers have</li>
<li>Run a competition for free tickets to an event your customer would love to go to in your local area. One of the great benefits of having a location centric business is your customer is near you</li>
<li>Include your customers in video or in user generated content</li>
<li>Offer rewards for customers who share an unboxing image or video tagging you</li>
<li>Implement Instagram shopping on your website and linked to your account</li>
<li>Engage an influencer who shares your customer</li>
<li>Share other Instagram pages and content that your customer audience also follows to broaden your reach</li>
<li>Always reply or like any comments</li>
<li>Uncover niche hashtags that your customer is also following. Similarly, location-specific hashtags are perfect for zeroing in on an audience in your own neighborhood.</li>
<li>Consider the time of day to share when you know your audience is on the platform. Set up a schedule for posting so you are also not on it 24/7!</li>
<li>Tell stories to captivate your audience, the narrative of your brand is just as important as your customer in your content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list can go on.. but you have a comprehensive guide now of how to get started right, even before you set your account. The next guide will cover setting up your account and then the final in the series is about creating the content with purpose to achieve your goals.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>McKinsey is a global management consulting firm and provides lots of research about business practice.<br />
They recently wrote an article called “Building an e-commerce business: The lessons on moving fast”.</p>
<p>With consumers moving online in reaction to coronavirus restrictions, companies will need to learn how to launch new e-commerce businesses and quickly. Although the article focuses on large corporates, the team at Confetti Design think there are plenty of lessons that small businesses can learn from the McKinsey article.</p>
<p>As the full implications of COVID-19 are still unknown, there is emerging evidence that  points to a significant shift from retail “bricks-and-mortar” to e-commerce and online selling, as customers find shops closed and are limited in their ability to leave the house. This is backed by data that shows e-commerce jumped from 15 to 20% in China and a whopping 81% in Italy. These dramatic growth stats are just for February to March this year!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How long does it take to create an ecommerce capability? We disagree with McKinsey!</strong></h2>
<p>We agree with McKinsey that businesses can create a working e-commerce site in much less time than they think. In their estimation an e-commerce site can be running in less than 4 months. Our experience with building small business e-commerce sites however is it can be far speedier, with many sites being developed in less than a month. In fact, we have examples of our small business e-commerce websites being up and running in less than two weeks – if product, pricing, content and images are ready to go.</p>
<p>We recently worked with <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/website-portfolio/purely-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Purely Christmas</a>, who are passionate about applying an aesthetic sensibility to Christmas decorations. The Founder of the business had spent 15 years in retail and had a great understanding of what she wanted to offer. Confetti Design was able to launch the website within four weeks, working closely with the Founder who was hands-on with product description and uploading products to meet a tight deadline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before work starts on launching an e-commerce presence, small business owners need to be practical and logical. In some cases, rather than attempting to launch a full-blown digital business across all markets at once, a strategy would be to go to market fast with a narrow offering and in limited localities. This will help to gain strong traction and then scale up and out aggressively. This ‘tight offering’ strategy is supported by current supply chain challenges. There is nothing worse than being enticed by a product or service only to find the items is ‘out of stock’ online. I have personally experienced this multiple times in past weeks.</p>
<p>Our customer, <a href="https://boatshed7.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boastshed 7</a> source premium beach gear, accessories and skincare that is carefully curated from around the globe. Boatshed 7 started their e-commerce website with a smaller product offering, rather than the large range of beach products they had on offer. This enabled their marketing team to learn as they sold beach products and to offer a more tailored product that was targeted to a specific type of customer. As small businesses learn more about their customer, they can add more products to the product offering thus adding value to existing customers and broadening your reach to new customers. This is what Boatshed 7 did!</p>

			<h3><strong>Marketing ecommerce websites</strong></h3>
<p>Marketing is the key element of e-commerce websites. An understanding of the customer decision journey from complete lack of awareness to the moment a customer landed on the home page for the first time is of the utmost importance. We would suggest you begin your marketing effort well before launch, up to nine weeks before the launch, but considering the climate we are in you want to think creatively about this part of the prep work.</p>
<p>Just a few ideas are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Consider who has the same customer as you and would they share your offering to their database?</li>
<li>Create content to share on multiple platforms that solve your ideal customers problems as it relates to your products, linking back to your website
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>How to docs</li>
<li>Lists of resources</li>
<li>Opinion pieces</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Lists of articles</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a sign-up offer to bring people onto your email list with the intention to not sell immediately but nurture them to eventually become purchasers</li>
<li>During COVID-19 consider your customer and what is important to them. As you prepare your offer or terms perhaps you offer a portion of proceeds to assist someone or something that is in alignment with your customer values</li>
<li>Drive as much traffic as you can to your site either engaging in organic SEO either yourself or from an agency driven strategy, ADwords campaigns, re-marketing or Google shopping to build your authority and also potential email lists as well as customers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><br />
Measure!!!</strong></h3>
<p>We absolutely agree with McKinsey on this one.<br />
One of the great benefits with e-commerce websites is the ability to measure traffic and conversion in real-time with tools like Google Analytics. You can set up goals for tracking giving you real insights into how effective your website is performing. It allows you to track the progress that matters so that you can learn, adapt, and drive continual improvement. It is not enough to measure overall conversion or conversion by channel. Instead, small businesses need more granular metrics, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>identify relevant customer groups</li>
<li>measure micro-conversions per group</li>
<li>then improve continually – make changes to the shopping experience to increase website conversion</li>
<li>what is the current path to a goal ?</li>
<li>how many steps it takes to get to a goal?</li>
<li>where are you losing visitors?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of our customers, <a href="/website-portfolio/my-lollies/">MyLollies</a>, offers a large range of sweets and confectionary. The team at MyLollies are active Google Analytics users, who regularly monitor and make changes to their product placement and offers in order to successfully increase conversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main message here is that the launch of an e-commerce website is not a separate project, but much more an ongoing program of continual improvement which will bring success.</p>
<h3><strong><br />
Product and service offering tweaking</strong></h3>
<p>Not all ideas will work and sell well online. McKinsey gave an example of staff-curated bundles of products that were based on common occasions, such as birthdays. This tested really well with customers in pre-launch, but simply didn’t perform well in reality. Small businesses need to be prepared to cut product bundles or special offers if they are not working.</p>
<p>By keeping to a weekly review schedule, you can pivot away from poor ideas and generate new ones constantly until you find ones that work. Every week the improvements and lessons accumulate, and by month three, the e-commerce business has matured into a state at which a good sales day isn’t a victory but business as usual.</p>
<p>Building an e-commerce presence from scratch is no small undertaking for business. It was great to read and confirm our experience that a clear plan that is properly structured, can not only deliver an e-commerce website, but do it far faster than you might think is possible.</p>

			<p>Small businesses are looking for ways to implement new business models ahead of complete lockdown. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has tipped every Australian small business into unknown territory where continuing to exist has become a daily challenge.</p>
<p>The decisions taken by our State and Federal Governments to flatten the curve as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads around the world have been particularly rough on small business owners who have been told to shut their doors. This includes hospitality businesses, entertainment and major sports events, sports, play centres, swimming pools, gyms and fitness classes. It also extends to beauty therapy, tanning, massage and tattoo parlour operators.</p>
<p>The lifeline to many small businesses will be working out how to pivot to generate income. For those that don’t have an online shop, transition to an online offering quickly will help you keep your revenue going. Read <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/helpful-ecommerce-related-articles-from-confetti-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> how to go about this.</p>
<p>Here are some great examples of what businesses have done to continue to trade:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Food service industry</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-13489 aligncenter" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog.jpg" alt="Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog" width="1099" height="630" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog.jpg 1099w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-300x172.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Relish-Mama-Confetti-Deisgn-Blog-768x440.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1099px) 100vw, 1099px" /></p>
<p>Many restaurants and café’s that have had to close down the dine-in option but added their menu to Uber Eats to keep trading.  Uber Eats does take 30% of your revenue so having the ordering functionality through your website will earn you more. They have however agreed, due to public pressure, for restaurants to receive daily payments rather than once a week during the pandemic, and will scrap service fees on pick-up orders until 30 June.</p>
<p>Some business who have done this are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Attica </strong>&#8211; Beautiful meals delivered and wine selected by the head Somillier<br />

<li><strong>Relish Mama</strong> – Known in Bayside for the amazing cooking classes Nellie Kerrison has been running for years has added Ready-made meals to her offering as in person classes are now cancelled. Fresh or frozen and pick up or delivery. She is also looking at adding virtual cooking classes. <a href="https://relishmama.com.au/homemade-ready-made-meals/">https://relishmama.com.au/homemade-ready-made-meals/</a></li>

<p>Most retail stores have an online presence already, the challenge now is to get found. If they don’t, now is the perfect time to add that revenue stream.<br />
Many local government councils are offering grants to finance this upgrade to your website.<br />

<h2><strong>Big Business</strong></h2>
<p>Small businesses aren&#8217;t the only ones adapting. With most large corporates all working virtually, there will be a need to maintain the culture and momentum regardless of staff location.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have put together five main reasons why your e-commerce website needs a blog.</p>
<p>A lot of things should be considered when maintaining a high performing e-commerce website. One important element you must consider is creating and maintaining a blog. A place to share articles, tips, resources or how to videos. Basically any kind of content to add value to your customers.  Fresh regular content helps your website remain relevant,  allowing you to build your brand voice and increase awareness of you and your products.</p>
<h2><strong><br />
1. Search Engine Optimisation</strong></h2>
<p>A well written blog ensures that there is educative content that can be indexed by search engines. It ultimately helps your online store be more searchable by related topics, hence generating more visitors to your site.</p>
<p>Blogs help enhance the quality of SEO since it points appropriate answers of customer inquiries to your website. Blog posts that use quality SEO tactics such as targeting relevant keywords, placing them strategically on titles, and writing appropriate meta data descriptions give your e-commerce site the opportunity to rank in search engines—and this is always good for business! If this term is sounding foreign, read <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/seo-services-melbourne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our SEO services </a> to help understand it more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>2. Increase Traffic on your Website</strong></h2>
<p>As a business owner, your goal is to pique the interest of your target market, so that they will visit your site and increase your chances of making a sale. Posting your blog links in social media increases your chances to accomplish that goal.</p>
<p>Create a blog which is catchy, informative, and up to date. Posting these blog links in your store’s social media accounts will serve as an ad for your website. Depending on how useful your blogs are to the readers, the blog link will generate clicks and drive visitors /  traffic to your website, which is a big step towards increasing your sales!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. Brand Identity</strong></h2>
<p>There are numerous steps into starting up your brand identity. You’ll have to think about your niche, your market, a catchy <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/how-to-name-small-business/">brand name</a>, and most especially—building your brand identity.</p>
<p>When you think about a product, a specific brand usually comes to mind. For example, when thinking about carbonated drinks or soft drinks, you’ll probably think about Coca Cola. Or when thinking about toothpaste, you’ll immediately think about Colgate. These brands established their identity throughout the years by executing effective marketing strategies, which helped them gain the trust and loyalty of their customers. Same can be done with e-commerce websites. A blog is another tool to use in establishing your identity in a world full of rival brands and similar products.</p>
<p>Blogging provides a voice to your business.  You can use it to build your business’s unique personality which separates you from your competitors. Things to consider are what do you want to be known for that are also important to your customer? How can you give personality and life to your brand through your writing?  Your initial blogs could include answers to the basic identity questions: 1- who are you, and 2- what value your product or service gives to your customers. These will be ingrained in your readers’ minds as you write more and more articles on your website. In time, your readers may become your customers and eventually, your brand ambassadors!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>4. Build an Online Community</strong></h2>
<p>If you keep posting helpful and relative blogs consistently, your community of readers which are originally your searchers will keep going back to your site for new information. The comments that your viewers leave in your blog will spark a meaningful conversation with like minded people about the topics.</p>
<p>Blogs that are personalized and relatable are the ones readers usually react to. Make your blogging as inclusive and interactive as possible, specially when you are trying to build a community of brand supporters. Write about how your product contributes or solves a problem in their life. Encourage comments and conversations within your blog as these will also help in making your blog rank higher in related topics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5. Enhance Your Writing Skills</strong></h2>
<p>As important as having including a blog in your e-commerce website is, making sure your content is relevant and easy to read it also vital. Writing them doesn’t just keep you well connected to your business and your brand, but also helps develop your communication skills.</p>
<p>Here are some factors to consider when you are starting to write a blog for your online store:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your relevance. </strong>If not talking about products or services you offer, your blog should always have a connection to what your online store is offering.</li>
<li><strong>Your audience. </strong>Some blog writers are so used to using technical terms that they forget to consider who the target audience is. Basic rule is to make sure your writing style is conversational and simple. A common standard is aim for it to be understood by a high schooler! Writing like the way you talk is often a great start. Ultimately the goal is to engage your target audience so they stay on your site for longer.</li>
<li><strong>Your structure. </strong>Keep a structure which allows your audience to fully digest your blog content. The basic structure of a blog is 1-having an introduction of the topic, 2- giving more details about the topic and sub topics, and finally, summarising the main message of your blog. Structure using a hierarchy of information is also important for ranking. Google is more likely to rank your articles if they are structures logically.</li>
<li><strong>Your consistency</strong>. Decide on whether you will write a blog on a weekly or a monthly basis. This will not only help you rank higher in search engines—it will also keep your customers informed of the current trends and news about your business. This will gain more engagement to your current and future customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The e-commerce world is growing rapidly, hence the continued importance of having a blog for your website. You may start with simple blogs and then later evolve to longer ones and don&#8217;t forget you can also include video, images or infographics. What is important though is you start now and reap its benefits not only for your online store but also to your ranking. With all these gains (and nothing to lose), why don’t you start blogging now?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many individuals have started their businesses by opening their own e-commerce website instead of a brick and mortar one. This is because aside from the fact that it has lower overhead costs, the online sales of goods have drastically grown over the years. If you’re one of those people who already have started or planning to start an online e-commerce store, you can be assured that you’re on the right track. But how exactly do we proceed?</p>
<p>Managing an e-commerce online business is as exciting as it can be stressful. We have gathered three of the most essential elements of an e-commerce website to ensure your success.</p>
<h2>Enticing Web Appearance</h2>
<p>The saying ‘first impressions last’ will always be true no matter what the case is—same for your online store. Your e-commerce website will be the first experience your customers will have of your business; and making it aesthetically appealing will increase your chances of turning your website visitors to loyal customers. However, gone are the days when we hear ‘the more, the merrier.’ In fact, we believe that having a clean, elegant design can help make your visitors stay longer browsing your online store.<br />
Aside from the overall web design, here are three items you need to consider which can help your online website more appealing and interactive:</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">1. Concise and complete product descriptions</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">People will always want to know exactly what they’re buying. Having a concise, complete, and well written product descriptions will establish the trust with your clients, making them customers for life!</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">2. High Quality and Proper Images for your Products</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Since your ecommerce website will be the first experience of your customers towards your product, make sure that you’ve placed the best images along with your exemplary product descriptions!</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">3. Call to Action Buttons</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As these buttons affect how your customers decide whether they will buy your product or not, it is important to pay attention on how you want it to look like on your e-commerce website. Consider your target market to decide on the text, color, and size of this button. Remember: this button transforms your website visitors into lifetime customers—make sure you design it well!</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">4. Product linking</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">How can you make it easy to buy MORE from you? Think strategically how your products work together, how can you sell more than one thing to a single customer? If they buy product A will they likely benefit from product B? Think about product bundling or recommend other items if they buy A that will help them, use the ecommerce smarts to place options near each other on the website pages.</p>
<h2>Effortless Customer Experience</h2>
<p>We cannot overemphasize the importance of making your customers at ease to your e-commerce website. Yours should be easy to navigate and visitor friendly. Here are some of the factors to consider, keeping customer experience in mind.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">1. Impressive Mobile Responsiveness</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As many people already use their mobile phones whenever they’re idle, they are also the ones who are likely to encounter your website one way or another. Your visitors should have a seamless experience of your website through their mobile phones, so make sure your website’s mobile responsiveness is excellent.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">2. Strategic Placement of Menus and Categories on your E-commerce Website</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As part of effortlessly navigating your website, situate your main menus or links to product categories in a strategic place that can easily get the attention of your customers, without interfering with your overall web design. You should also pay careful attention to your product categories, ensuring that each product is correctly tagged, showing up in logical categories to help the shopper buy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Also, ensure that your customers can easily return to the home page or main menu while browsing. Always make your contact information and shopping cart available for viewing, and they are linked to their respective pages.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">3. Easy Online Store Checkout Process</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Your customers have already decided to buy your product, so the checkout process should be as simple (but functional) as possible. Give an option to purchase as guest visitor, as many customers discontinue buying the product just because of the long and tedious process of signing up. Offer multiple payment and delivery methods. And lastly, pricing should be as transparent as possible, including discounts, extra fees, and even the shipping fees.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">4. Responsive Customer Support</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">You must assure your customers that when they need more information or if they encounter a problem buying your products, someone will be there to assist them with their needs. There are multiple ways that you can do this—set up a chat app in your website, send an email option, or encourage the customers to call your hotline. What’s important is to set the turnaround time for response for these channels. When you are responsive to your customers’ needs, there is a higher possibility that they’ll be your customers for life.</p>
<h2>Exceptional Content that Drives Traffic To your E-commerce Website</h2>
<p>A very important consideration to ensure the success of your ecommerce business is to have relevant, interesting, and “sharable” content which will push traffic to your website. You can start with simple but informative materials about the product or service you are promoting, and the following are several methods to accomplish this.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">1. Influence SEO</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We all know that Search Engine Optimisation or SEO is a marketing strategy that allows your website to rank on search engines, hence increasing the traffic to your site. But how do you start doing this? These are simple yet effective ways to impact SEO.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">• Start a blog. Writing relative content that use keywords connected to your ecommerce shop increases your probability to rank higher in search engines. Read more about why a blog is so important <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/why-your-e-commerce-website-needs-a-blog/">here</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">• Add relevant keywords. Using keywords in your blogs or other contents that are connected to your products or services will also have a positive impact on your site ranking.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">• Build internal links. Create links within your website so that Google will index your whole site.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">2. Video Content</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Video consumption has skyrocketed and is a continuing trend not looking to slow down. Creating video content that stimulates and intrigues your site visitors will likely increase the traffic in your site as well as your store’s sales. Think of a video content that is relevant to your site, such as introduction on what you offer, or a video of unboxing your product. Make sure that videos are well made and sound is clear!<br />
Think about your products and how will your customer interact with them? Is it hair accessories? Share video content on how to use the accessories showing your added value to help your customer.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">3. Infographics</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Presenting your information through words is good, but why limit yourself to words when you can use infographics or mixed media graphics for something a bit different? They can be as informative as they are visually pleasing, so your site visitors will look forward to your next post.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">4. Social Media Content</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Your social media posts are as important as all the other content you post in your website. There is boundless audience in the social media platforms and getting them to link to your site or buy your products via social will increase brand awareness. Make your content relative to your products and services and your target audience. Successful social content is often humorous, mostly honest and relatable to your audience. The goal though is always to get the viewer to your website. One day the social platform may close down but you always have 100% control over your e-commerce website.</p>
<p>The combination of having a visually stimulating website, exceptional customer service, and great product is the perfect balance to an e-commerce website. These elements need constant care and attention as your business and client base grows, and it can be challenging. Remember the satisfaction you’ll have seeing the success of your online shop is worth all the challenges you’ll encounter!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As a design agency we observe that an online store really needs to be starting their marketing as early as possible to build a following or audience to then launch to.  So many times people are eager to spend $1000's of dollars on the store but only to find when they launch there are crickets, no sales and marketing is hard work. </p>

Her feed is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stateofelliott/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and her online store is <a href="https://stateofelliott.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Secure your social handles
<ul>
<li>This is really important from a brand perspective and ideally you would do this when you have registered your domain name and business name. You do not want it to be different as that makes life confusing for your customers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose the right platform
<ul>
<li>Your product and audience will determine the best social platform for you. Consider where your target market hangs out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up your profile with great pics
<ul>
<li>Use your brand guidelines and keep it consistent.</li>
<li>Where possible get professional photo’s taken to make a great first impression</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a content calendar plan
<ul>
<li>Mapping out your themes for posting will help with content creation and your feed will look fabulous from a brand perspective. Consistency is a great way to build followers and trust.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Link the tracking codes to your website so you monitor which performs the best</li>
<li>Consider which to integrate as an additional sales channel. You may wish to test one first or all at once. Each platform has a slightly different audience so best to create a strategy for each. Could be less burdensome to test the best one first, track effectiveness before launching into a second. (see our links below to our trusted suppliers if you wish to outsource this task)</li>
<li>We often observe, very importantly that you need to start your marketing as early as possible to build a pre-launch audience.  Using Social is a very cost effective way to do this. Blogging and sharing your &#8216;brand&#8217; voice and value to gain a following is highly beneficial so that when you launch you have an audience watching.</li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>2. Get Your Email Marketing Ready&#8230;.. </strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Choose your email provider<br />There are many providers out there that have free accounts with basics. Here are a few, some free and some paid:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mailchimp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.activecampaign.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Campaign</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.getresponse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Response</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design email communications and a newsletter template
<ul>
<li>Think about the audience and what they really want to know. A newsletter is not about selling products directly, tell stories, build trust, solve problems while also promoting offers</li>
<li>Plan your calendar
<ol type="a">
<li>Create a range of topics to share that coincide with what is relevant to your target audience life, in the news, relates to times of the year. I’ve made a full list of some dates for you <a href="/e-commerce-calendar/">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Consider the customer process emails, what they look like and content to make you stand out. These can be automated and can include:
<ol type="a">
<li>Welcome series</li>
<li>E-receipts</li>
<li>Abandoned cart notifications</li>
<li>Order confirmation</li>
<li>Shipping notifications</li>
<li>Order review request</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. Install Analytics&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>Analytics are important to set up from day one. This data will give you valuable insight into your visitors and customers, their activity on your site and what is working well and what needs improvement.</p>
<p>If you use Shopify as your online store platform it has its own set of analytics reporting built in, but we suggest you also install <a href="https://www.shopify.com.au/blog/14681601-google-analytics-for-ecommerce-a-beginners-guide">Google Analytics</a>. There are plenty of other options in the market but Google Analytics is one of the most well-known and popular analytics tools.<br /><a id="keyword"></a></p>

<h2><strong>4. Do Your Keyword Research&#8230;..</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1487" height="861" class="wp-image-12400" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool.png" alt="launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool.png 1487w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-300x174.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-768x445.png 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-1024x593.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1487px) 100vw, 1487px" /></figure>
<p>The preparation for this task is all around what do you want to be found for? Another way to consider prepping your site and product pages is to answer this question What will your customer be using as the phrases or key words in Google to find your products? You can also use the search bar in Google that predicts what you are searching for as broad guessing but for accurate data you will need a Google Adwords account. Within the dashboard once logged in (top nav Tools) you can use the Keyword Planner to find exact statistics on what phrases people are using to find your products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>If you use Shopify as your online store platform it has its own SEO fields at the bottom of each product page to be completed. If you use WordPress / Woo Commerce you will need to add an SEO plugin such as Yoast, it one of the most well-known and popular SEO tools.</li>
<li>Check Page Titles
<ul>
<li>Check that page titles are appropriate and optimised for search. They should include key terms and be formatted correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check Meta Descriptions
<ul>
<li>Ensure that all media elements on your site such as your page images or product images have meta descriptions and titles. These should be relevant to your content and descriptive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check URLs
<ul>
<li>Check that all of your URLs are simple and relevant to the page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5. Decide Your KPI&#8217;s&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Starting a business it is important to know your numbers. Such as:
<ul>
<li>How much does my product cost, per unit, landed to customer front door?</li>
<li>What are the true shipping costs. This means you need to include, all fulfillment components, such as staff related picking and packing costs, software, postage, packaging etc.?</li>
<li>What are your merchant processing fees?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set yourself very specific revenue goals, down to daily numbers, this helps you understand what activity you need to do to achieve the sales goals and will help with testing what sales tactics, channels work more successfully. Your product may have an expiration date, so moving product by set dates will be vital. You don’t want to be stuck with unsellable inventory.</li>
<li>Look for ways to cut costs, as your sales volume increases you maybe able to negotiate raw material bulk discounts or better shipping rates.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>6. Know Your Shipping Strategy&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="752" class="wp-image-12404" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-1024x752.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-1024x752.jpg 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-300x220.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-768x564.jpg 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Online Store Packaging
<ul>
<li>Unboxing has become an opportunity to surprise and delight your customer, an opportunity to make a great first impression. A UK packaging company did a survey and found that 20% of packaging was not a good fit for the product, and 15% used too much packaging. Also 7% of products arrived damaged as a result of inappropriate packaging. This is a vital part of your launch. Some other useful information from this survey to help you with your online store packaging is:
<ol type="a">
<li>appropriateness of outer packaging size</li>
<li>durability of packaging</li>
<li>ease of opening</li>
<li>amount of packaging materials used</li>
<li>recyclability of packaging</li>
<li>ability to use packaging for returns</li>
<li>use of branding</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shipping options
<ul>
<li>Make shipping as easy as possible with a couple of options that make the customers life easier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shipping costs and times
<ul>
<li>Be clear about these so that you manage a customers expectations, including tracking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>7. Finalise the Launch promotion&#8230;.</strong></h2>

<li>Running a giveaway is a great launch marketing tactic to get traffic and subscribers quickly. Giveaways have the added benefit of increasing your brand presence and product visibility especially when launching. Building an email list gives you a group of warm leads to work with, making the sales process much easier. Your first product reviews will be useful for many platforms so the more of these you get while in the early days the better.</li>
<li>You can provide first-time visitors with a discount coupon or voucher when they first land to use at checkout consumers can help boost sales.</li>
<li>Create a plan that includes your chosen social platform.</li>
<li>Get media
<ul>
<li>You may have an opportunity to get media depending on your personal story and how it relates to the launch of your product.</li>
<li>It could be beneficial to delay your launch or speed it up to leverage off what is topical or in the news.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plan the launch and first impressions.
<ul>
<li>You only get to launch once so make it count; first sales, first customer interactions, first social engagement, these all count.</li>
<li>Prepare for mistakes as things will not go to plan! This can include a ‘make good’ message / gift or a clever ‘404’ page on your website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Affiliates / Partners
<ul>
<li>You can investigate partner and affiliate marketing to boost your brand presence by offering affiliate marketing options and partnering with other online retailers.</li>
<li>You can offer bloggers who share your target audience a free sample of your product in exchange for reviews. If you’re selling products on Amazon, one easy way to gain consumer respect and confidence (and reviews) is to ask for feedback. Include a card with each product that asks for an honest review and provides contact information for your company</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So there you have our 7 steps to launching your Ecommerce business.</p>

<p>Thе fасt іѕ thеrе аrе nо books listing business names like we have for baby names. When it comes to how to name a small business we use a set of steps in our process that helps us move down a creative path. I’ve named over 7 businesses and a dozen products so here are my key 5 steps to guide you in how to get started.</p>
<h3>STEP 1: Dіѕсоvеrу</h3>
<p>Fіrѕt, wе lеаrn аll аbоut уоu аnd уоur nаmіng сhаllеngе. Wе іmmеrѕе оurѕеlvеѕ іn аll rеlеvаnt mаrkеtіng mаtеrіаlѕ, іnсludіng роѕіtіоnіng dосumеntѕ, іnfоrmаtіоn аbоut уоur аudіеnсеѕ аnd соmреtіtіvе ѕеt (іnсludіng соmреtіtоrѕ’ brаnd nаmеѕ), аnd рrеvіоuѕlу соnѕіdеrеd nаmе саndіdаtеѕ, іf аnу. Tурісаllу, when we work with a new business they have no documentation and so they start with our Clarity Process to unearth all the vital essence of their business. Often we’ll ѕtrаtеgіzе аnd dеtеrmіnе kеу раrаmеtеrѕ fоr уоur nаmіng рrоjесt, іnсludіng уоur nаmіng оbjесtіvеѕ, dеѕіrеd mеѕѕаgеѕ, рrеfеrrеd nаmіng ѕtуlеѕ аnd соnѕtruсtіоnѕ, аnd аnу lеgаl іѕѕuеѕ. Whеn іt соmеѕ tо nаmіng, thе dіѕсоvеrу рrосеѕѕ іѕ vіtаl.</p>
<p>At the discovery ѕtаgе іt’ѕ іmреrаtіvе tо rеасh a соnѕеnѕuѕ аmоngѕt dесіѕіоn-mаkеrѕ аѕ tо whаt thе оbjесtіvе сrіtеrіа аrе fоr the business and it’s nаmе. Thіѕ wіll mаkе thіngѕ muсh ѕmооthеr dоwn thе rоаd, whеn іt’ѕ tіmе tо dесіdе bеtwееn a ѕhоrtlіѕt оf nаmеѕ. Yоu ѕhоuld hаvе a сlеаr сhесklіѕt оf аttrіbutеѕ thаt уоu rеquіrе оf a nаmе, ѕо whеn a lіѕt оf соntеndеrѕ іѕ рrеѕеntеd, thе dесіѕіоn dоеѕn’t bоіl dоwn еntіrеlу tо gut fееlіng. These might be integrity, fun, leadership, responsive, encompassing one age group or location. Onе іmроrtаnt thіng tо kеер іn mіnd whеn dеvеlоріng уоur сrіtеrіа іѕ thаt a grеаt brаnd nаmе dоеѕn’t trу tо rерrеѕеnt tоо muсh. It fосuѕеѕ оn thе соmmunісаtіоn оf оnе or two сеntrаl іdеаs, or a set of values or core message, іnѕtеаd оf trуіng tо bе a саtсhаll fоr еvеrуthіng thе оrgаnіzаtіоn ѕtаndѕ fоr.</p>
<h3>STEP 2: Crеаtіvе Brіеf</h3>
<p>If you are using an Agency like us there should be a guiding document used in the process. Ours is called Confetti Clarity Questionnaire. Thе brіеf ѕhоuld ѕуnthеѕіzе аnd dіѕtіll іnѕіghtѕ аnd оbjесtіvеѕ glеаnеd frоm thе dіѕсоvеrу рrосеѕѕ, аnd оutlіnе a рrороѕеd nаmіng ѕtrаtеgу fоr сrеаtіvе еxрlоrаtіоnѕ. Thіѕ is whеrе уоu gаthеr thе rаw іdеаѕ thаt wіll ѕеrvе аѕ fоddеr fоr уоur nаmе. Inѕріrеd bу thе соrе mеѕѕаgіng аnd buѕіnеѕѕ оbjесtіvеѕ оf уоur оrgаnіzаtіоn, the creative brief іѕ a соllаbоrаtіvе рrосеѕѕ аmоngѕt ѕtrаtеgіѕtѕ аnd ѕtаkеhоldеrѕ.</p>
<h3>STEP 3: Crеаtіvе Exрlоrаtіоn</h3>
<p>Onсе уоu аррrоvе thе сrеаtіvе brіеf, we dеvеlор аn еxtеnѕіvе lіѕt оf nаmе іdеаѕ. We’ll thеn ѕhоrtlіѕt a ѕubѕеt tо ѕсrееn fоr trаdеmаrk аvаіlаbіlіtу if that is part of the business strategy and for domain name availabiltiy. Onсе a lоng lіѕt іѕ сrеаtеd, thе рrосеѕѕ оf whіttlіng bеgіnѕ, аnd thе оbjесtіvе сrіtеrіа bесоmе mоrе іnѕtruсtіvе. Whеn dеlіbеrаtіng оvеr whеthеr a nаmе ѕhоuld mаkе thе сut, іt саn bе uѕеful tо рut thе nаmе іn hуроthеtісаl соntеxtuаl ѕіtuаtіоnѕ. Hоw іѕ thіѕ nаmе gоіng tо lооk оn a buѕіnеѕѕ саrd? A wеbѕіtе? Hоw dоеѕ іt ѕоund whеn ѕаіd оn іtѕ оwn, аѕ wеll аѕ whеn uѕеd іn vаrіоuѕ ѕеntеnсеѕ? If you are on this journey alone it is good to have on hand one or two trusted advisors or a potential customer to present these too for objective feedback. What do they think of when they hear the name? Is this in alignment with our goals for the business brand? We believe in testing our thinking but not canvassing lots of people as that can end in simply opinions not strategic objective feedback.</p>
<p>In thе creative рhаѕе, wе also consider hоw mаrkеtаblе a nаmе іѕ, hоw іt lооkѕ аеѕthеtісаllу, іtѕ rеlеvаnсе, whаt tуре оf brаnd vоісе іt еmbоdіеѕ, аnd іtѕ аbіlіtу tо dіffеrеntіаtе a brаnd frоm іtѕ соmреtіtіоn. Aѕ mеntіоnеd іn thе іntrоduсtіоn, a nаmе hаѕ tо hаvе thе роwеr tо tеll a mеаnіngful ѕtоrу аbоut thе brаnd. Hоw a nаmе wіll fіgurе іntо уоur brаnd’ѕ nаrrаtіvе іѕ оf grеаt іmроrtаnсе.</p>
<h3>STEP 4: Prеѕеntаtіоn</h3>
<p>We wіll рrеѕеnt multірlе rоundѕ оf сrеаtіvе wоrk, ѕо we саn bеttеr gаugе аnd rеѕроnd tо уоur nаmе ѕtуlе рrеfеrеnсеѕ аnd рrоgrеѕѕіvеlу rеfіnе thеmаtіс dіrесtіоnѕ fоr the business nаme. Oftеn, we wіll рrеѕеnt nаmеѕ іn ѕоmе kіnd оf соntеxt (whеthеr іt’ѕ a tаglіnе оr оthеr mаrkеtіng сору, оr a vіѕuаl соntеxt lіkе a bіllbоаrd оr расkаgе). We often present a business name as a draft logo.</p>
<p>Thе lеѕѕ quаlіtаtіvе ѕіdе оf thе tеѕtіng рhаѕе іѕ ѕсrееnіng fоr lеgаl vіаbіlіtу аnd роtеntіаl trаdеmаrk іѕѕuеѕ. Trаdеmаrk аvаіlаbіlіtу саn bе аmоng thе mоѕt сhаllеngіng оbѕtасlеѕ fасіng a brаnd nаmе thеѕе dауѕ. Nаmеѕ ѕhоuld bе rеvіеwеd аnd аррrоvеd bу іntеllесtuаl рrореrtу аttоrnеуѕ bеfоrе аnу асtіоn іѕ tаkеn. Thе аvаіlаbіlіtу оf URLѕ аnd ѕосіаl mеdіа сhаnnеlѕ ѕhоuld bе аѕѕеѕѕеd аѕ wеll.</p>
<h3>STEP 5: Fіnаl Sеlесtіоn аnd Lаunсh</h3>
<p>Thе fіnаl ѕеlесtіоn оf a nаmе саn bе a dіffісult рrороѕіtіоn. But thе аbоvе рrосеѕѕ іѕ dеѕіgnеd tо mаkе іt аѕ ѕtrаіghtfоrwаrd аѕ роѕѕіblе, іllumіnаtіng thе rеlаtіvе vаluе іn еасh оf thе nаmеѕ оn уоur ѕhоrtlіѕt. In thе еnd, сhооѕіng a nаmе from the final list dоеѕ іnvоlvе a bіt оf gut fееlіng. Yоu ѕhоuld knоw іntuіtіvеlу whісh оf уоur ѕhоrtlіѕtеd nаmеѕ fееlѕ rіght, аnd bеѕt аlіgnѕ wіth уоur brаnd реrѕоnаlіtу.</p>
<p>Onсе уоu’vе gоt соnѕеnѕuѕ аmоngѕt dесіѕіоn-mаkеrѕ, іt’ѕ tіmе tо рull thе trіggеr. Thе lаunсh оf a nеw nаmе саn bе еіthеr tеrrіfуіnglу unсеrtаіn оr соnfіdеntlу thrіllіng. Tаkіng thе рrосеѕѕ оnе ѕtер аt a tіmе аnd mаkіng ѕurе tо lау thе nесеѕѕаrу grоundwоrk mаkе thе lаttеr a muсh mоrе lіkеlу оutсоmе.</p>
<p>We then take this amazing new name and all it represents into the branding stage and the visual fun begins.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently had a session with my Intuitive Business Coach, Monique Evans of <a href="http://www.intuitivefreedom.com" target="_blank">Intuitive Freedom</a>&nbsp;where she asked if my business purpose/ mission statement or ‘manifesto’ was still relevant? She has her finger on the pulse that woman and has insights&nbsp;that always surprise me.</p>
<p>It’s been 3 years since we set our ‘why’ and&nbsp;purpose and wrote the mission for Confetti Design so it was a timely question. And having not thought of our mission statement or conscious business purpose as a ‘manifesto’ I took the invitation to delve into this new world. How did I want to step forward into this world with 3 years of business under my belt. What did we want to stand for now? What do we want be know for?&nbsp;How do we want to be remembered in the work we produce or the experiences we provide for our clients.</p>
<p>After getting my ‘google-on’ and reading a few dozen articles on Google to get my head around:&nbsp;What is a manifesto? I now have a fair idea what this ‘manifesto’ biz is about. This article will look at what is a manifesto; how it can be a powerful tool for your business and personal life and some tips on how to write one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is a manifesto?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, a manifesto is a written statement where you publicly declare your…&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Intentions (what you intend to do)</li>
<li>Beliefs (what your opinions are; your view of a particular topic)</li>
<li>Vision (the type of business / life or world that you dream about and wish to create)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my findings, manifestos of all varieties are cool and there are no real rules except your main goal is for someone to get a better feeling of you or greater understanding of you, your business or project after reading it. Of course a personal manifesto can be very very private and personal and shared with no-one, choice is yours.</p>
<p>In terms of a business manifesto, a good one makes us think ‘this is a business with meaning; these people get it.’ The best business manifestos really need to be written with your customers in mind. They consider what the primary purpose of your business is and tell people what change you wish to bring.</p>
<blockquote><p>“People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.”&nbsp;~ Simon Sinek</p></blockquote>
<p>When we work with our clients on their branding and websites they undergo a thorough briefing process where we encourage them to watch the Ted talk of Simon’s called <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action" target="_blank">Start With Why</a>. This actually allows our clients to identify their purpose for business. It allows us to get into their hearts and minds and gives us the magic insights to design a brand and online presence that truly represents their higher purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Benefits of a manifesto?</h2>
<p>The great by-product of a manifesto is that like values, once set you have a framework in which to make decisions more easily, evaluation opportunities and stick to your priorities when conflicts arise.</p>
<p>Therefore we can see a manifesto is a great way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarify your beliefs</li>
<li>Name your guiding purpose for being in business</li>
<li>Examine your&nbsp;motivations</li>
<li>Create “policies”</li>
<li>Describe what kind of business you’d like to own or work in</li>
<li>The type of values your customers would have</li>
<li>Write down your goals</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your manifesto doesn’t have to be extreme or only written once. It doesn’t need to be long. It can be bullet points; or you could write it like a letter. You could even review each year to see how your goals have changed or values evolved.</p>
<p>A manifesto could encompass goals for the whole life of your business, or a goal for one product or service, a goal for a shorter period or for a project. See a few below for inspiration including how Apple use their manifesto as a guiding light for business culture and product development. And Seth Goden’s could be adopted by any sales or marketing business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here is Apple’s Manifesto written by Tim Cook</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em> We believe that we’re on the face of the earth to make great products.</em></li>
<li><em> We’re constantly focusing on innovating.</em></li>
<li><em> We believe in the simple, not the complex.</em></li>
<li><em> We believe we need to own and control the primary&nbsp;technologies&nbsp;behind the products that we make and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution.</em></li>
<li><em> We believe in saying no to thousands of projects so that we can focus on the few that are meaningful to us.</em></li>
<li><em>6.We believe in deep collaboration&nbsp;and cross pollination in order to innovate in a way others cannot.</em></li>
<li><em>We don’t settle for anything other than excellence in any group in the company.</em></li>
<li><em>We have the self-honesty to admit when we’re wrong and the courage to change.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Seth Goden’s – my favourite marketing guru</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em> The greatest innovations appear to come from those that are self-reliant. Individuals who go right to the edge and do something worth talking about. Not solo, of course, but as instigators of a team. In two words: don’t settle.</em></li>
<li><em> The greatest marketers do two things: they treat customers with respect and they measure.</em></li>
<li><em> The greatest salespeople understand that people resist change and that ‘no’ is the single easiest way to do that.</em></li>
<li><em> The greatest bloggers blog for their readers, not for themselves.</em></li>
<li><em> There really isn’t much a of ‘short run’. It quickly becomes yesterday. The long run, on the other hand, sticks around for quite a while.</em></li>
<li><em> The internet doesn’t forget. And sooner or later, the internet finds out.</em></li>
<li><em> Everyone is a marketer, even people and organizations that don’t market. They’re just marketers who are doing it poorly.</em></li>
<li><em> Amazing organizations and people receive rewards that more than make up for the effort required to be that good.</em></li>
<li><em> There is no number 9.</em></li>
<li><em> Mass taste is rarely good taste.</em></li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>How do you write your manifesto for your business?</strong></h2>
<p>Here are some great questions to ask to get you started that I found in another article, the full text&nbsp;is visible <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/why-everyone-should-write-a-manifesto.html">HERE</a>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I believe that everyone _______ (has these qualities and rights).</em></li>
<li><em>I believe it is important to _______ (do certain things when servicing clients, replying, sending an on-boarding gift or document).</em></li>
<li><em>In my business, clients and I treat each other _______ (in these ways).</em></li>
<li><em>In my world, _______ (describe your desired working environment).</em></li>
<li><em>My personal policy is _______ (what are your values to work and live by).</em></li>
<li><em>I believe that I am uniquely equipped to _______ (do something meaningful to help others achieve_____).</em></li>
<li><em>My overarching personal goal is _______ (add sub-goals if desired).</em></li>
<li><em>My overall business/career goal is _______ (add sub-goals if desired).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I really like these questions as the spark thinking around values, the type of experience I hope to provide clients and also to guide the type of clients I really like working with. This ensures it&#8217;s super easy to say yes or no to a project. These questions also allow you to highlight your strengths as an integral part of your manifesto and goals.</p>
<p>If these questions haven&#8217;t resonated or you have trouble identifying your ‘why’ through the Simon Sinek approach, <a href="http://www.valuablecontent.co.uk/blog/how-to-write-a-business-manifesto" target="_blank">Valuable Content</a> have a couple of great exercises to use, summarized below.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a rant to see what really riles you and gets up passionate</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>When it comes to your industry what really winds you up?</li>
<li>What do you rile against?</li>
<li>What does everyone else get wrong?</li>
<li>What could be so much better if people only DID SOMETHING about it?</li>
<li>If you were King or Queen of your industry what would STOP happening RIGHT NOW!!!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Then flip it</strong></p>
<p>Then turn the negatives into positives. When you do this ensure it keeps the perspective on the customer not you.</p>
<p>As an example your rant maybe:<br />
“I hate the way small businesses are treated like second class citizens in the business world. There’s just not enough of the right support out there, and their contribution to the UK economy is seriously underplayed.”</p>
<p>Flip it to:<br />
“Small business is the lifeblood of the UK economy, and it deserves the very best support.”</p>
<p>Make sure your statement doesn’t become:<br />
“I service small business better than anyone”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do some customer research to get your tone of voice right for your manifesto.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What matters to your customers?</li>
<li>How does your approach make things better for them?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can then find the intersection of your principles or values and those of your clients. Making these a manifesto feature or a ‘sticky’ service goal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all my reading and exploring of the range of manifesto&#8217;s I am going to lock myself away for a few hours and refine our purpose led mission statement into a manifesto. I am liking this approach to help guide us in the next phase of our business existence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best of luck with your manifesto or purpose driven mission statement for your business.</p>
