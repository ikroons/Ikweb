]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many individuals have started their businesses by opening their own e-commerce website instead of a brick and mortar one. This is because aside from the fact that it has lower overhead costs, the online sales of goods have drastically grown over the years. If you’re one of those people who already have started or planning to start an online e-commerce store, you can be assured that you’re on the right track. But how exactly do we proceed?</p>
<p>Managing an e-commerce online business is as exciting as it can be stressful. We have gathered three of the most essential elements of an e-commerce website to ensure your success.</p>
<h2>Enticing Web Appearance</h2>
<p>The saying ‘first impressions last’ will always be true no matter what the case is—same for your online store. Your e-commerce website will be the first experience your customers will have of your business; and making it aesthetically appealing will increase your chances of turning your website visitors to loyal customers. However, gone are the days when we hear ‘the more, the merrier.’ In fact, we believe that having a clean, elegant design can help make your visitors stay longer browsing your online store.<br />
Aside from the overall web design, here are three items you need to consider which can help your online website more appealing and interactive:</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">1. Concise and complete product descriptions</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">People will always want to know exactly what they’re buying. Having a concise, complete, and well written product descriptions will establish the trust with your clients, making them customers for life!</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">2. High Quality and Proper Images for your Products</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Since your ecommerce website will be the first experience of your customers towards your product, make sure that you’ve placed the best images along with your exemplary product descriptions!</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">3. Call to Action Buttons</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As these buttons affect how your customers decide whether they will buy your product or not, it is important to pay attention on how you want it to look like on your e-commerce website. Consider your target market to decide on the text, color, and size of this button. Remember: this button transforms your website visitors into lifetime customers—make sure you design it well!</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">4. Product linking</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">How can you make it easy to buy MORE from you? Think strategically how your products work together, how can you sell more than one thing to a single customer? If they buy product A will they likely benefit from product B? Think about product bundling or recommend other items if they buy A that will help them, use the ecommerce smarts to place options near each other on the website pages.</p>
<h2>Effortless Customer Experience</h2>
<p>We cannot overemphasize the importance of making your customers at ease to your e-commerce website. Yours should be easy to navigate and visitor friendly. Here are some of the factors to consider, keeping customer experience in mind.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">1. Impressive Mobile Responsiveness</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As many people already use their mobile phones whenever they’re idle, they are also the ones who are likely to encounter your website one way or another. Your visitors should have a seamless experience of your website through their mobile phones, so make sure your website’s mobile responsiveness is excellent.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">2. Strategic Placement of Menus and Categories on your E-commerce Website</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As part of effortlessly navigating your website, situate your main menus or links to product categories in a strategic place that can easily get the attention of your customers, without interfering with your overall web design. You should also pay careful attention to your product categories, ensuring that each product is correctly tagged, showing up in logical categories to help the shopper buy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Also, ensure that your customers can easily return to the home page or main menu while browsing. Always make your contact information and shopping cart available for viewing, and they are linked to their respective pages.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">3. Easy Online Store Checkout Process</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Your customers have already decided to buy your product, so the checkout process should be as simple (but functional) as possible. Give an option to purchase as guest visitor, as many customers discontinue buying the product just because of the long and tedious process of signing up. Offer multiple payment and delivery methods. And lastly, pricing should be as transparent as possible, including discounts, extra fees, and even the shipping fees.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">4. Responsive Customer Support</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">You must assure your customers that when they need more information or if they encounter a problem buying your products, someone will be there to assist them with their needs. There are multiple ways that you can do this—set up a chat app in your website, send an email option, or encourage the customers to call your hotline. What’s important is to set the turnaround time for response for these channels. When you are responsive to your customers’ needs, there is a higher possibility that they’ll be your customers for life.</p>
<h2>Exceptional Content that Drives Traffic To your E-commerce Website</h2>
<p>A very important consideration to ensure the success of your ecommerce business is to have relevant, interesting, and “sharable” content which will push traffic to your website. You can start with simple but informative materials about the product or service you are promoting, and the following are several methods to accomplish this.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">1. Influence SEO</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We all know that Search Engine Optimisation or SEO is a marketing strategy that allows your website to rank on search engines, hence increasing the traffic to your site. But how do you start doing this? These are simple yet effective ways to impact SEO.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">• Start a blog. Writing relative content that use keywords connected to your ecommerce shop increases your probability to rank higher in search engines. Read more about why a blog is so important <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/why-your-e-commerce-website-needs-a-blog/">here</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">• Add relevant keywords. Using keywords in your blogs or other contents that are connected to your products or services will also have a positive impact on your site ranking.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">• Build internal links. Create links within your website so that Google will index your whole site.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">2. Video Content</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Video consumption has skyrocketed and is a continuing trend not looking to slow down. Creating video content that stimulates and intrigues your site visitors will likely increase the traffic in your site as well as your store’s sales. Think of a video content that is relevant to your site, such as introduction on what you offer, or a video of unboxing your product. Make sure that videos are well made and sound is clear!<br />
Think about your products and how will your customer interact with them? Is it hair accessories? Share video content on how to use the accessories showing your added value to help your customer.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">3. Infographics</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Presenting your information through words is good, but why limit yourself to words when you can use infographics or mixed media graphics for something a bit different? They can be as informative as they are visually pleasing, so your site visitors will look forward to your next post.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;">4. Social Media Content</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Your social media posts are as important as all the other content you post in your website. There is boundless audience in the social media platforms and getting them to link to your site or buy your products via social will increase brand awareness. Make your content relative to your products and services and your target audience. Successful social content is often humorous, mostly honest and relatable to your audience. The goal though is always to get the viewer to your website. One day the social platform may close down but you always have 100% control over your e-commerce website.</p>
<p>The combination of having a visually stimulating website, exceptional customer service, and great product is the perfect balance to an e-commerce website. These elements need constant care and attention as your business and client base grows, and it can be challenging. Remember the satisfaction you’ll have seeing the success of your online shop is worth all the challenges you’ll encounter!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As a design agency we observe that an online store really needs to be starting their marketing as early as possible to build a following or audience to then launch to.  So many times people are eager to spend $1000's of dollars on the store but only to find when they launch there are crickets, no sales and marketing is hard work. </p>

			<p>Launching any business is full of tasks but to launch an e-commerce business is that much harder as there are more details to be considered.</p>
<p>These include inventory, product descriptions, refund policies, shipping, offers, customer service, great product photography, packaging, abandoned cart communications, up-selling to name a few,.</p>
<p>Not being prepared is a recipe for disaster which is why I’ve used all our client experiences to create a 7-point list to help you consider the marketing launch side of your new online store.</p>

<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Secure your social handles
<ul>
<li>This is really important from a brand perspective and ideally you would do this when you have registered your domain name and business name. You do not want it to be different as that makes life confusing for your customers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose the right platform
<ul>
<li>Your product and audience will determine the best social platform for you. Consider where your target market hangs out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set up your profile with great pics
<ul>
<li>Use your brand guidelines and keep it consistent.</li>
<li>Where possible get professional photo’s taken to make a great first impression</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a content calendar plan
<ul>
<li>Mapping out your themes for posting will help with content creation and your feed will look fabulous from a brand perspective. Consistency is a great way to build followers and trust.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Link the tracking codes to your website so you monitor which performs the best</li>
<li>Consider which to integrate as an additional sales channel. You may wish to test one first or all at once. Each platform has a slightly different audience so best to create a strategy for each. Could be less burdensome to test the best one first, track effectiveness before launching into a second. (see our links below to our trusted suppliers if you wish to outsource this task)</li>
<li>We often observe, very importantly that you need to start your marketing as early as possible to build a pre-launch audience.  Using Social is a very cost effective way to do this. Blogging and sharing your &#8216;brand&#8217; voice and value to gain a following is highly beneficial so that when you launch you have an audience watching.</li>

<li>Choose your email provider<br />There are many providers out there that have free accounts with basics. Here are a few, some free and some paid:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mailchimp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.activecampaign.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Campaign</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.getresponse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Response</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design email communications and a newsletter template
<ul>
<li>Think about the audience and what they really want to know. A newsletter is not about selling products directly, tell stories, build trust, solve problems while also promoting offers</li>
<li>Plan your calendar
<ol type="a">
<li>Create a range of topics to share that coincide with what is relevant to your target audience life, in the news, relates to times of the year. I’ve made a full list of some dates for you <a href="/e-commerce-calendar/">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Consider the customer process emails, what they look like and content to make you stand out. These can be automated and can include:
<ol type="a">
<li>Welcome series</li>
<li>E-receipts</li>
<li>Abandoned cart notifications</li>
<li>Order confirmation</li>
<li>Shipping notifications</li>
<li>Order review request</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3. Install Analytics&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>Analytics are important to set up from day one. This data will give you valuable insight into your visitors and customers, their activity on your site and what is working well and what needs improvement.</p>
<p>If you use Shopify as your online store platform it has its own set of analytics reporting built in, but we suggest you also install <a href="https://www.shopify.com.au/blog/14681601-google-analytics-for-ecommerce-a-beginners-guide">Google Analytics</a>. There are plenty of other options in the market but Google Analytics is one of the most well-known and popular analytics tools.<br /><a id="keyword"></a></p>

<h2><strong>4. Do Your Keyword Research&#8230;..</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1487" height="861" class="wp-image-12400" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool.png" alt="launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool.png 1487w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-300x174.png 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-768x445.png 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/launch-e-commerce-google-keyword-planner-tool-1024x593.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1487px) 100vw, 1487px" /></figure>
<p>The preparation for this task is all around what do you want to be found for? Another way to consider prepping your site and product pages is to answer this question What will your customer be using as the phrases or key words in Google to find your products? You can also use the search bar in Google that predicts what you are searching for as broad guessing but for accurate data you will need a Google Adwords account. Within the dashboard once logged in (top nav Tools) you can use the Keyword Planner to find exact statistics on what phrases people are using to find your products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>If you use Shopify as your online store platform it has its own SEO fields at the bottom of each product page to be completed. If you use WordPress / Woo Commerce you will need to add an SEO plugin such as Yoast, it one of the most well-known and popular SEO tools.</li>
<li>Check Page Titles
<ul>
<li>Check that page titles are appropriate and optimised for search. They should include key terms and be formatted correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check Meta Descriptions
<ul>
<li>Ensure that all media elements on your site such as your page images or product images have meta descriptions and titles. These should be relevant to your content and descriptive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check URLs
<ul>
<li>Check that all of your URLs are simple and relevant to the page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5. Decide Your KPI&#8217;s&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Starting a business it is important to know your numbers. Such as:
<ul>
<li>How much does my product cost, per unit, landed to customer front door?</li>
<li>What are the true shipping costs. This means you need to include, all fulfillment components, such as staff related picking and packing costs, software, postage, packaging etc.?</li>
<li>What are your merchant processing fees?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Set yourself very specific revenue goals, down to daily numbers, this helps you understand what activity you need to do to achieve the sales goals and will help with testing what sales tactics, channels work more successfully. Your product may have an expiration date, so moving product by set dates will be vital. You don’t want to be stuck with unsellable inventory.</li>
<li>Look for ways to cut costs, as your sales volume increases you maybe able to negotiate raw material bulk discounts or better shipping rates.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>6. Know Your Shipping Strategy&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="752" class="wp-image-12404" src="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-1024x752.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-1024x752.jpg 1024w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-300x220.jpg 300w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging-768x564.jpg 768w, https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Launch-E-Commerce-Store-packaging.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Online Store Packaging
<ul>
<li>Unboxing has become an opportunity to surprise and delight your customer, an opportunity to make a great first impression. A UK packaging company did a survey and found that 20% of packaging was not a good fit for the product, and 15% used too much packaging. Also 7% of products arrived damaged as a result of inappropriate packaging. This is a vital part of your launch. Some other useful information from this survey to help you with your online store packaging is:
<ol type="a">
<li>appropriateness of outer packaging size</li>
<li>durability of packaging</li>
<li>ease of opening</li>
<li>amount of packaging materials used</li>
<li>recyclability of packaging</li>
<li>ability to use packaging for returns</li>
<li>use of branding</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shipping options
<ul>
<li>Make shipping as easy as possible with a couple of options that make the customers life easier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shipping costs and times
<ul>
<li>Be clear about these so that you manage a customers expectations, including tracking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>7. Finalise the Launch promotion&#8230;.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="blog-list">
<li>Running a giveaway is a great launch marketing tactic to get traffic and subscribers quickly. Giveaways have the added benefit of increasing your brand presence and product visibility especially when launching. Building an email list gives you a group of warm leads to work with, making the sales process much easier. Your first product reviews will be useful for many platforms so the more of these you get while in the early days the better.</li>
<li>You can provide first-time visitors with a discount coupon or voucher when they first land to use at checkout consumers can help boost sales.</li>
<li>Create a plan that includes your chosen social platform.</li>
<li>Get media
<ul>
<li>You may have an opportunity to get media depending on your personal story and how it relates to the launch of your product.</li>
<li>It could be beneficial to delay your launch or speed it up to leverage off what is topical or in the news.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plan the launch and first impressions.
<ul>
<li>You only get to launch once so make it count; first sales, first customer interactions, first social engagement, these all count.</li>
<li>Prepare for mistakes as things will not go to plan! This can include a ‘make good’ message / gift or a clever ‘404’ page on your website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Affiliates / Partners
<ul>
<li>You can investigate partner and affiliate marketing to boost your brand presence by offering affiliate marketing options and partnering with other online retailers.</li>
<li>You can offer bloggers who share your target audience a free sample of your product in exchange for reviews. If you’re selling products on Amazon, one easy way to gain consumer respect and confidence (and reviews) is to ask for feedback. Include a card with each product that asks for an honest review and provides contact information for your company</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Have you heard Google want you to switch your site to HTTPS?</h1>
<p>#updated July 2018 &#8211; this is now more important than last year and all sites need to have an HTTPS.</p>
<h3>Firstly what is HTTPS?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure</strong></span> (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The &#8216;S&#8217; at the end of HTTPS stands for &#8216;Secure&#8217;. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. So essentially an https offers a secure method for hosting your website. It’s recongnised by the padlock in the browser bar.</p>
<h3>Some background information.</h3>
<p>In 2014 Google announced in a campaign that they would start to rank secure pages over unsecure ones. 3 years later and now it’s more than just a ranking issues, Google and many others want the web to be more secure in general. If you think about it we want that too. We all know how our information is taken and stored for re-targetting and it is only going to become more invasive of our surfing activities.</p>
<p>In August 2014 Google had their HTTPS everywhere campaign, they announced HTTPS as a ranking signal.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cBhZ6S0PFCY?ecver=1" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first they noted that “for now it’s only a very lightweight signal,” but over time Google “may decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to encourage all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.” Then on Sept. 8, 2016 <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/09/moving-towards-more-secure-web.html">Google announced</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SSL-blog-turn-my-site-into-https.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4062 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SSL-blog-turn-my-site-into-https-e1488491428543.png" alt="SSL-blog-turn-my-site-into-https" width="662" height="231" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Early this year, 2017,</strong> </span>version 56 of the Chrome web browser was released. There is a significant change in the way it displays websites that are not using HTTPS, also known as holding an SSL certificate. This change may confuse your site visitors or surprise you if you are not expecting it.</p>
<p>Starting with the release of Chrome 56 in Januart, any website that is not running HTTPS will have a message appear in the location bar that says “Not Secure” on pages that collect passwords or credit cards. It will look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/not_secure.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3971" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/not_secure.png" alt="not_secure-turn-my-site-into-https" width="300" height="136" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may confuse your site visitors who land on your site or sign into it because they may interpret the message to indicate that your website has been compromised. They could also interpret the message to mean that your site has some underlying security issue other than being non-HTTPS. The initial changes will affect websites that collect login and credit card information over http but as Google rolls out their plan to secure web privacy across the internet we can be sure that change is coming soon and it is sensible to get it sorted sooner rather than later.</p>
<h3>The nitty gritty of why you should make your site an HTTPS?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong> Google identifies several reasons to switch to HTTPS in their website migration guide:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Encrypting</strong> the exchanged data to keep it secure from eavesdroppers. That means that while the user is browsing a website, nobody can “listen” to their conversations, track their activities across multiple pages or steal their information.</li>
<li><strong>Data integrity. </strong>Data cannot be modified or corrupted during transfer, intentionally or otherwise, without being detected.</li>
<li>Proves that your users communicate with the intended website. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks and builds user trust, which translates into other business benefits.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> SSL benefit to search rankings. </strong>Everyone with a business website wants to achieve strong rankings in the SERPS (search engine results pages) — but it isn’t easy. With literally hundreds of different and evolving criteria used in Google’s algorithm, you want to use every available tool to your advantage. <strong>SSL encryption can help your website rank higher in search results.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Trust: </strong>If you have contact forms on your site or need to take any information, seeing the HTTPS and green padlock will add to the trust perception and let potential contacts know their submission is protected and that you are not a fly-by-night operation. Certificate Authorities also offer <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/find-my-site-seal-code-3441">Trust Seals</a> that you can display on your site. In addition to the padlock and HTTPS in your browser location bar, these graphics give website visitors an additional visual indication that you have SSL encryption in place.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>How do you transfer from HTTP to an HTTPS?</h3>
<p>There are quite a few steps involved to move to an HTTPS, Google has a guide <u><a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6073543?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</u> In essence you need to purchase an SSL Certificate, load it onto your website sever then map all the pages / images / content / links ulrs from http to https.</p>

<p><strong> </strong><strong>Types Of SSL Certificate</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous types and brands of SSL Certificate and whilst they all work using the same principle they do offer different features.</p>
<p>Here is a high level overview:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain SSL</strong> – Most popular type of SSL. Browser Padlock shows. Domain Name only appears in browser bar. Low cost and instant issue. No paperwork, no waiting. Limited to one domain only. (The type we are offering to install)</li>
<li><strong>Wildcard SSL</strong> – Same as Domain SSL but extends to sub domains of this domain (not available on Extended SSL – see below)</li>
<li><strong>Organization SSL</strong> – More expensive SSL with domain ownership and Company verification required. Usually issued in 1 to 2 business days. Browser Padlock shows with Domain Name &amp; Company Name appearing.</li>
<li><strong>Extended SSL</strong> – Most expensive type of SSL which requires domain ownership and Company verification as well as legal, physical &amp; operational verification required. Usually issued within 3 to 4 business days. Extended validation with green browser bar showing company name.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2 Install SSL Certificate</h4>
<p>For the purpose of brevity we will assume that a Domain SSL is being purchased as you are a single person business and are concerned with the installation of the SSL and the switch to HTTPS rather than the vetting procedure of an Organization or Extended SSL.</p>
<p>Your webmaster or hosting company will then create the Certificate Signing Request and perform the installation of the certificate.</p>
<p>To install an SSL your site must have a Dedicated IP address. If your site doesn’t have a dedicated IP address you will need to change your hosting plan or host. Some hosts will do this once you start the installation process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 3 Backup Your Website</h4>
<p>As a security measure before redirecting your site to HTTPS we recommend making a full backup of your website.</p>
<p>This is an optional step and is only in case there are any issues and you need to restore your files. As a rule it is sensible to take a back-up of your site regularly.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 4 Configure Hard Links In Your Website</h4>
<p>Because you are switching from HTTP to HTTPS the internal links in your website need to reflect this otherwise they will return 404 errors (file not found).</p>
<p>If you have a small website you can do this by hand or get a Developer to make these changes.</p>
<p>However, if you have a large site maybe hundreds or even thousands of pages there are tools that can help you to do this very quickly.</p>
<p>If you use WordPress you can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/velvet-blues-update-urls/">Velvet Blues Update URLs Plugin</a> or the <a href="https://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/">interconnectit – search replace php script</a>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 5 Update Tools &amp; Code Libraries</h4>
<p>This usually won’t apply unless you have a larger, more complex website.</p>
<p>If you are using different tools for your website for extra functionality such as JavaScript or Ajax then be sure to update these so that they will work when you switch to HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 6 Change Any External Links Under Your Control</h4>
<p>If you have external websites pointing to your site (i.e. backlinks) you should change any that you have under your control from HTTP to HTTPS. Mostly these will be things like directory listings.</p>
<p>Most of the time they won’t be under your control though but don’t worry about this as you will be making changes later that will redirect any HTTP traffic to HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 7 Implement 301 Redirects</h4>
<p>A 301 redirect is a permanent redirection that you can set up to tell any HTTP traffic to now go to the HTTPS equivalent.</p>
<p>If you are not an experienced Web Professional then this is probably best left to a developer.</p>
<p>Depending on your webserver you will need to setup sitewide direction.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 8 Update Links In 3rd Party Tools &amp; Transactional Emails</h4>
<p>If you’re using any third party applications such an email marketing tool, marketing automation or Customer Relationship Management tool then you’ll need to run a manual check on any links that you’ve created there to make sure they’re all up to date.</p>
<p>Likewise if you have a billing system your transactional emails such as welcome emails and any invoice emails need to be updated to reflect the change. Of course the redirection you’ve set up previously will forward any HTTP links to the HTTPS equivalent but it’s always more professional to correct these.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 9 Update Landing Pages &amp; Paid Search Links</h4>
<p>If you have any landing pages setup then these will have been updated automatically by the 301 redirect but for completeness you should double check these.</p>
<p>Also check the links you are using in the paid search tools you are using whether that’s Google, Facebook or whatever.</p>
<p>Also if you use a Landing Page generator then you should update your setting there to reflect the switch.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h4>Step 10 Update Google Search Console &amp; Google Analytics</h4>
<p>Finally you need to make sure that you update your Google Search Console (Google Webmaster Tools) by submitting the new HTTPS site as well as re-submitting your SiteMap.</p>
<p>Also don’t forget Google Analytics to make sure that you can get the correct analytics. That’s just a question of setting the ‘Default URL’ to HTTPS.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Wrap Up</h3>
<p>Switching to HTTPS has a few steps involved. But increasingly security is important and sooner or later you will need to make the switch.</p>
<p>Choose the right sort of SSL for your needs. There are several types and whilst they all work the same there are varying degrees of verification and also the way the browser appears, such as the green browser bar.</p>

<p>Thе fасt іѕ thеrе аrе nо books listing business names like we have for baby names. When it comes to how to name a small business we use a set of steps in our process that helps us move down a creative path. I’ve named over 7 businesses and a dozen products so here are my key 5 steps to guide you in how to get started.</p>
<h3>STEP 1: Dіѕсоvеrу</h3>
<p>Fіrѕt, wе lеаrn аll аbоut уоu аnd уоur nаmіng сhаllеngе. Wе іmmеrѕе оurѕеlvеѕ іn аll rеlеvаnt mаrkеtіng mаtеrіаlѕ, іnсludіng роѕіtіоnіng dосumеntѕ, іnfоrmаtіоn аbоut уоur аudіеnсеѕ аnd соmреtіtіvе ѕеt (іnсludіng соmреtіtоrѕ’ brаnd nаmеѕ), аnd рrеvіоuѕlу соnѕіdеrеd nаmе саndіdаtеѕ, іf аnу. Tурісаllу, when we work with a new business they have no documentation and so they start with our Clarity Process to unearth all the vital essence of their business. Often we’ll ѕtrаtеgіzе аnd dеtеrmіnе kеу раrаmеtеrѕ fоr уоur nаmіng рrоjесt, іnсludіng уоur nаmіng оbjесtіvеѕ, dеѕіrеd mеѕѕаgеѕ, рrеfеrrеd nаmіng ѕtуlеѕ аnd соnѕtruсtіоnѕ, аnd аnу lеgаl іѕѕuеѕ. Whеn іt соmеѕ tо nаmіng, thе dіѕсоvеrу рrосеѕѕ іѕ vіtаl.</p>
<p>At the discovery ѕtаgе іt’ѕ іmреrаtіvе tо rеасh a соnѕеnѕuѕ аmоngѕt dесіѕіоn-mаkеrѕ аѕ tо whаt thе оbjесtіvе сrіtеrіа аrе fоr the business and it’s nаmе. Thіѕ wіll mаkе thіngѕ muсh ѕmооthеr dоwn thе rоаd, whеn іt’ѕ tіmе tо dесіdе bеtwееn a ѕhоrtlіѕt оf nаmеѕ. Yоu ѕhоuld hаvе a сlеаr сhесklіѕt оf аttrіbutеѕ thаt уоu rеquіrе оf a nаmе, ѕо whеn a lіѕt оf соntеndеrѕ іѕ рrеѕеntеd, thе dесіѕіоn dоеѕn’t bоіl dоwn еntіrеlу tо gut fееlіng. These might be integrity, fun, leadership, responsive, encompassing one age group or location. Onе іmроrtаnt thіng tо kеер іn mіnd whеn dеvеlоріng уоur сrіtеrіа іѕ thаt a grеаt brаnd nаmе dоеѕn’t trу tо rерrеѕеnt tоо muсh. It fосuѕеѕ оn thе соmmunісаtіоn оf оnе or two сеntrаl іdеаs, or a set of values or core message, іnѕtеаd оf trуіng tо bе a саtсhаll fоr еvеrуthіng thе оrgаnіzаtіоn ѕtаndѕ fоr.</p>
<h3>STEP 2: Crеаtіvе Brіеf</h3>
<p>If you are using an Agency like us there should be a guiding document used in the process. Ours is called Confetti Clarity Questionnaire. Thе brіеf ѕhоuld ѕуnthеѕіzе аnd dіѕtіll іnѕіghtѕ аnd оbjесtіvеѕ glеаnеd frоm thе dіѕсоvеrу рrосеѕѕ, аnd оutlіnе a рrороѕеd nаmіng ѕtrаtеgу fоr сrеаtіvе еxрlоrаtіоnѕ. Thіѕ is whеrе уоu gаthеr thе rаw іdеаѕ thаt wіll ѕеrvе аѕ fоddеr fоr уоur nаmе. Inѕріrеd bу thе соrе mеѕѕаgіng аnd buѕіnеѕѕ оbjесtіvеѕ оf уоur оrgаnіzаtіоn, the creative brief іѕ a соllаbоrаtіvе рrосеѕѕ аmоngѕt ѕtrаtеgіѕtѕ аnd ѕtаkеhоldеrѕ.</p>
<h3>STEP 3: Crеаtіvе Exрlоrаtіоn</h3>
<p>Onсе уоu аррrоvе thе сrеаtіvе brіеf, we dеvеlор аn еxtеnѕіvе lіѕt оf nаmе іdеаѕ. We’ll thеn ѕhоrtlіѕt a ѕubѕеt tо ѕсrееn fоr trаdеmаrk аvаіlаbіlіtу if that is part of the business strategy and for domain name availabiltiy. Onсе a lоng lіѕt іѕ сrеаtеd, thе рrосеѕѕ оf whіttlіng bеgіnѕ, аnd thе оbjесtіvе сrіtеrіа bесоmе mоrе іnѕtruсtіvе. Whеn dеlіbеrаtіng оvеr whеthеr a nаmе ѕhоuld mаkе thе сut, іt саn bе uѕеful tо рut thе nаmе іn hуроthеtісаl соntеxtuаl ѕіtuаtіоnѕ. Hоw іѕ thіѕ nаmе gоіng tо lооk оn a buѕіnеѕѕ саrd? A wеbѕіtе? Hоw dоеѕ іt ѕоund whеn ѕаіd оn іtѕ оwn, аѕ wеll аѕ whеn uѕеd іn vаrіоuѕ ѕеntеnсеѕ? If you are on this journey alone it is good to have on hand one or two trusted advisors or a potential customer to present these too for objective feedback. What do they think of when they hear the name? Is this in alignment with our goals for the business brand? We believe in testing our thinking but not canvassing lots of people as that can end in simply opinions not strategic objective feedback.</p>
<p>In thе creative рhаѕе, wе also consider hоw mаrkеtаblе a nаmе іѕ, hоw іt lооkѕ аеѕthеtісаllу, іtѕ rеlеvаnсе, whаt tуре оf brаnd vоісе іt еmbоdіеѕ, аnd іtѕ аbіlіtу tо dіffеrеntіаtе a brаnd frоm іtѕ соmреtіtіоn. Aѕ mеntіоnеd іn thе іntrоduсtіоn, a nаmе hаѕ tо hаvе thе роwеr tо tеll a mеаnіngful ѕtоrу аbоut thе brаnd. Hоw a nаmе wіll fіgurе іntо уоur brаnd’ѕ nаrrаtіvе іѕ оf grеаt іmроrtаnсе.</p>
<h3>STEP 4: Prеѕеntаtіоn</h3>
<p>We wіll рrеѕеnt multірlе rоundѕ оf сrеаtіvе wоrk, ѕо we саn bеttеr gаugе аnd rеѕроnd tо уоur nаmе ѕtуlе рrеfеrеnсеѕ аnd рrоgrеѕѕіvеlу rеfіnе thеmаtіс dіrесtіоnѕ fоr the business nаme. Oftеn, we wіll рrеѕеnt nаmеѕ іn ѕоmе kіnd оf соntеxt (whеthеr іt’ѕ a tаglіnе оr оthеr mаrkеtіng сору, оr a vіѕuаl соntеxt lіkе a bіllbоаrd оr расkаgе). We often present a business name as a draft logo.</p>
<p>Thе lеѕѕ quаlіtаtіvе ѕіdе оf thе tеѕtіng рhаѕе іѕ ѕсrееnіng fоr lеgаl vіаbіlіtу аnd роtеntіаl trаdеmаrk іѕѕuеѕ. Trаdеmаrk аvаіlаbіlіtу саn bе аmоng thе mоѕt сhаllеngіng оbѕtасlеѕ fасіng a brаnd nаmе thеѕе dауѕ. Nаmеѕ ѕhоuld bе rеvіеwеd аnd аррrоvеd bу іntеllесtuаl рrореrtу аttоrnеуѕ bеfоrе аnу асtіоn іѕ tаkеn. Thе аvаіlаbіlіtу оf URLѕ аnd ѕосіаl mеdіа сhаnnеlѕ ѕhоuld bе аѕѕеѕѕеd аѕ wеll.</p>
<h3>STEP 5: Fіnаl Sеlесtіоn аnd Lаunсh</h3>
<p>Thе fіnаl ѕеlесtіоn оf a nаmе саn bе a dіffісult рrороѕіtіоn. But thе аbоvе рrосеѕѕ іѕ dеѕіgnеd tо mаkе іt аѕ ѕtrаіghtfоrwаrd аѕ роѕѕіblе, іllumіnаtіng thе rеlаtіvе vаluе іn еасh оf thе nаmеѕ оn уоur ѕhоrtlіѕt. In thе еnd, сhооѕіng a nаmе from the final list dоеѕ іnvоlvе a bіt оf gut fееlіng. Yоu ѕhоuld knоw іntuіtіvеlу whісh оf уоur ѕhоrtlіѕtеd nаmеѕ fееlѕ rіght, аnd bеѕt аlіgnѕ wіth уоur brаnd реrѕоnаlіtу.</p>
<p>Onсе уоu’vе gоt соnѕеnѕuѕ аmоngѕt dесіѕіоn-mаkеrѕ, іt’ѕ tіmе tо рull thе trіggеr. Thе lаunсh оf a nеw nаmе саn bе еіthеr tеrrіfуіnglу unсеrtаіn оr соnfіdеntlу thrіllіng. Tаkіng thе рrосеѕѕ оnе ѕtер аt a tіmе аnd mаkіng ѕurе tо lау thе nесеѕѕаrу grоundwоrk mаkе thе lаttеr a muсh mоrе lіkеlу оutсоmе.</p>
<p>We then take this amazing new name and all it represents into the branding stage and the visual fun begins.</p>

			<p>When we create an engaging and captivating website that attracts perfect match customers, images are a huge part of the process. I thought the best way share the importance of the right images is to talk to a professional photographer.</p>
<p>This is part 1 of a 3 part series about select images for your website when you are designing a successful marketing website tool.</p>
<p>Let me introduce Fi Mims from Fi Mims Photography branding photographer, based in Melbourne, Australia. Fi is out go-to photographer for our clients and after reading this interview you will understand why! She is passionate, creative, a joy to work with, and gets results every time.</p>
<p>See some of her images below for her clients and also our clients. We encourage clients to get not just a branding image but also make their services stand out by using images of them at work. It is a very easy way to stand out from your competitors and to connect with a website visitor.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<ol>
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">Fear or anxiety can seriously ruin a shoot. Most people will let their anxiety come through in their expression, how do you help eliminate this as the images you take are always so beautiful?</li>
</ol>
<p>As the photographer my first responsibility is to make sure the person in front of my camera is comfortable, and I think this is something you just get better at with time. If someone is nervous I’ll talk to them and ask them questions – about their work, their family, their recent holiday. I pick topics I think will either distract them from the camera, or light them up and put a sparkle in their eye! And if all else fails I tell silly jokes</p>
<p>The other important thing I do is help my clients arrive at their shoot feeling prepared. To do this I send them questionnaires and pre-session guides. In many cases we also talk at length on the phone so I can answer questions or respond to any fears they have around the shoot – common ones are what to wear, what to bring. I expect clients to arrive nervous, but if they can also arrive feeling like they are as prepared as possible then that’s half my job done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">Is there a go to pose people can practise at home before coming to a shoot? Do you even recommend this, I mean should someone practice their poses or expressions before the shoot at all?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it’s a good idea to know how you want to come across in your photos. If my clients have seen images they love I encourage them to share these with me via an inspiration board on Pinterest, as that way I can use them as a guide to capture the look or feel they want to achieve. But when it comes to posing I think it’s best to leave this up to your photographer on the day – after all, that’s one of the reasons why you hired them! Your photographer should have the skill to pose you in a way that is flattering, and to bring our your natural expressions. Poses or positions that feel comfortable may not always look great through the perspective of the camera lens, so just relax and let your photographer guide you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What is your top tip to rock any photoshoot even for those people that hate having their photo taken?</li>
</ol>
<p>My one tip would probably be to book a professional hair and makeup artist, because stepping in front of the camera knowing you look amazing will help your confidence enormously. I see this all the time with my clients! I work with a great team of professional makeup artists who will meet women at the studio before their session upon request. Not only do they make them look and feel great, but it also gives them an hour to relax and just be calm before their session – it’s such a great way to walk into a shoot and the women that do it, love it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What should someone bring to a photoshoot?</li>
</ol>
<p>Plenty of outfit options so we can pick and choose what works best on the day, props relevant to their brand if they want to include these, and a clear idea of what they want to achieve through their images. And a sense of fun! You have nothing to lose when you step in front of the camera, so just enjoy yourself and relax as much as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">Would you recommend a stylist to come to a shoot?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the more you can invest in your session the better. So if you think you would benefit from either working with a stylist before your session, or having one on hand during the shoot, then go for it. More and more of my clients are working with personal stylists before their session to help them select what to wear, and the result is always great. What you wear is an important element to any image, and my clients struggle with this more than anything else. Those that work with stylists before their photo shoot always arrive feeling more confident because they don’t have to worry about how they look.</p>
<p>You really just have to assess what you want from your session and decide whether a stylist will be a worthwhile investment, or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What is the difference between a headshot and a branding portrait?</li>
</ol>
<p>A headshot is a photo of someone that focuses on their face, and is cropped to just include their head and shoulders. It’s an image so people know what you look like. A branding portrait is much more than this. A branding portrait should tell a story. It should communicate a person’s personality and their brand, and help customers connect with them. In today’s competitive market, branding portraits are a great way to stand out and make sure you get noticed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What’s the #1 mistake you see women entrepreneurs (or men) make with their photography? (This is my way of asking what really chaps your a** when it comes to photography you see online!)</li>
</ol>
<p>I suppose I get most frustrated when I see people using poor quality images over professional photography. How are people supposed to take your brand seriously when you don’t? I also get disappointed when I see stock photography used to represent brands that would be so much better represented by authentic images that show the business owner and what they do. Professional photography is an investment, but it doesn’t have to be a huge one. And when you think of the value it can offer to a business in terms of lifting its brand profile, communicating a message and attracting the right customers, there is no question as to whether or not it’s a worthwhile one.</p>
<p>People are visual beings, and we only have a few seconds to grab their attention and impress them, so great images are the best investment you can make in yourself and your business!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently had a session with my Intuitive Business Coach, Monique Evans of <a href="http://www.intuitivefreedom.com" target="_blank">Intuitive Freedom</a>&nbsp;where she asked if my business purpose/ mission statement or ‘manifesto’ was still relevant? She has her finger on the pulse that woman and has insights&nbsp;that always surprise me.</p>
<p>It’s been 3 years since we set our ‘why’ and&nbsp;purpose and wrote the mission for Confetti Design so it was a timely question. And having not thought of our mission statement or conscious business purpose as a ‘manifesto’ I took the invitation to delve into this new world. How did I want to step forward into this world with 3 years of business under my belt. What did we want to stand for now? What do we want be know for?&nbsp;How do we want to be remembered in the work we produce or the experiences we provide for our clients.</p>
<p>After getting my ‘google-on’ and reading a few dozen articles on Google to get my head around:&nbsp;What is a manifesto? I now have a fair idea what this ‘manifesto’ biz is about. This article will look at what is a manifesto; how it can be a powerful tool for your business and personal life and some tips on how to write one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is a manifesto?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, a manifesto is a written statement where you publicly declare your…&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Intentions (what you intend to do)</li>
<li>Beliefs (what your opinions are; your view of a particular topic)</li>
<li>Vision (the type of business / life or world that you dream about and wish to create)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my findings, manifestos of all varieties are cool and there are no real rules except your main goal is for someone to get a better feeling of you or greater understanding of you, your business or project after reading it. Of course a personal manifesto can be very very private and personal and shared with no-one, choice is yours.</p>
<p>In terms of a business manifesto, a good one makes us think ‘this is a business with meaning; these people get it.’ The best business manifestos really need to be written with your customers in mind. They consider what the primary purpose of your business is and tell people what change you wish to bring.</p>
<blockquote><p>“People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.”&nbsp;~ Simon Sinek</p></blockquote>
<p>When we work with our clients on their branding and websites they undergo a thorough briefing process where we encourage them to watch the Ted talk of Simon’s called <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action" target="_blank">Start With Why</a>. This actually allows our clients to identify their purpose for business. It allows us to get into their hearts and minds and gives us the magic insights to design a brand and online presence that truly represents their higher purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Benefits of a manifesto?</h2>
<p>The great by-product of a manifesto is that like values, once set you have a framework in which to make decisions more easily, evaluation opportunities and stick to your priorities when conflicts arise.</p>
<p>Therefore we can see a manifesto is a great way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarify your beliefs</li>
<li>Name your guiding purpose for being in business</li>
<li>Examine your&nbsp;motivations</li>
<li>Create “policies”</li>
<li>Describe what kind of business you’d like to own or work in</li>
<li>The type of values your customers would have</li>
<li>Write down your goals</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your manifesto doesn’t have to be extreme or only written once. It doesn’t need to be long. It can be bullet points; or you could write it like a letter. You could even review each year to see how your goals have changed or values evolved.</p>
<p>A manifesto could encompass goals for the whole life of your business, or a goal for one product or service, a goal for a shorter period or for a project. See a few below for inspiration including how Apple use their manifesto as a guiding light for business culture and product development. And Seth Goden’s could be adopted by any sales or marketing business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here is Apple’s Manifesto written by Tim Cook</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em> We believe that we’re on the face of the earth to make great products.</em></li>
<li><em> We’re constantly focusing on innovating.</em></li>
<li><em> We believe in the simple, not the complex.</em></li>
<li><em> We believe we need to own and control the primary&nbsp;technologies&nbsp;behind the products that we make and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution.</em></li>
<li><em> We believe in saying no to thousands of projects so that we can focus on the few that are meaningful to us.</em></li>
<li><em>6.We believe in deep collaboration&nbsp;and cross pollination in order to innovate in a way others cannot.</em></li>
<li><em>We don’t settle for anything other than excellence in any group in the company.</em></li>
<li><em>We have the self-honesty to admit when we’re wrong and the courage to change.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Seth Goden’s – my favourite marketing guru</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><em> The greatest innovations appear to come from those that are self-reliant. Individuals who go right to the edge and do something worth talking about. Not solo, of course, but as instigators of a team. In two words: don’t settle.</em></li>
<li><em> The greatest marketers do two things: they treat customers with respect and they measure.</em></li>
<li><em> The greatest salespeople understand that people resist change and that ‘no’ is the single easiest way to do that.</em></li>
<li><em> The greatest bloggers blog for their readers, not for themselves.</em></li>
<li><em> There really isn’t much a of ‘short run’. It quickly becomes yesterday. The long run, on the other hand, sticks around for quite a while.</em></li>
<li><em> The internet doesn’t forget. And sooner or later, the internet finds out.</em></li>
<li><em> Everyone is a marketer, even people and organizations that don’t market. They’re just marketers who are doing it poorly.</em></li>
<li><em> Amazing organizations and people receive rewards that more than make up for the effort required to be that good.</em></li>
<li><em> There is no number 9.</em></li>
<li><em> Mass taste is rarely good taste.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tim Ferris’</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Define : Define your ideal lifestyle.<br />
</em><em>Eliminate : Eliminate everything extraneous.<br />
</em><em>Automate : Build an automatic, sustainable source of income.<br />
</em><em>Liberate : Be mobile and free yourself from your location.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lululemon’s</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do one thing a day that scares you.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life is full of setbacks. Success is determined by how you handle setbacks.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your outlook on life is a direct reflection of how much you like yourself.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stress is related to 99% of all illness.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jealousy works the opposite way you want it to.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friends are more important than money.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Living in the moment could be the meaning of life.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visualize your eventual demise. It can have an amazing effect on how you live for the moment.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practice yoga so you can remain active in physical sports as you age.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dance, sing, floss and travel.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children are the orgasm of life.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweat once a day to regenerate your skin.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we do to the earth we do to ourselves.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pursuit of happiness is the source of all unhappiness.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How do you write your manifesto for your business?</strong></h2>
<p>Here are some great questions to ask to get you started that I found in another article, the full text&nbsp;is visible <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/why-everyone-should-write-a-manifesto.html">HERE</a>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I believe that everyone _______ (has these qualities and rights).</em></li>
<li><em>I believe it is important to _______ (do certain things when servicing clients, replying, sending an on-boarding gift or document).</em></li>
<li><em>In my business, clients and I treat each other _______ (in these ways).</em></li>
<li><em>In my world, _______ (describe your desired working environment).</em></li>
<li><em>My personal policy is _______ (what are your values to work and live by).</em></li>
<li><em>I believe that I am uniquely equipped to _______ (do something meaningful to help others achieve_____).</em></li>
<li><em>My overarching personal goal is _______ (add sub-goals if desired).</em></li>
<li><em>My overall business/career goal is _______ (add sub-goals if desired).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I really like these questions as the spark thinking around values, the type of experience I hope to provide clients and also to guide the type of clients I really like working with. This ensures it&#8217;s super easy to say yes or no to a project. These questions also allow you to highlight your strengths as an integral part of your manifesto and goals.</p>
<p>If these questions haven&#8217;t resonated or you have trouble identifying your ‘why’ through the Simon Sinek approach, <a href="http://www.valuablecontent.co.uk/blog/how-to-write-a-business-manifesto" target="_blank">Valuable Content</a> have a couple of great exercises to use, summarized below.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a rant to see what really riles you and gets up passionate</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>When it comes to your industry what really winds you up?</li>
<li>What do you rile against?</li>
<li>What does everyone else get wrong?</li>
<li>What could be so much better if people only DID SOMETHING about it?</li>
<li>If you were King or Queen of your industry what would STOP happening RIGHT NOW!!!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Then flip it</strong></p>
<p>Then turn the negatives into positives. When you do this ensure it keeps the perspective on the customer not you.</p>
<p>As an example your rant maybe:<br />
“I hate the way small businesses are treated like second class citizens in the business world. There’s just not enough of the right support out there, and their contribution to the UK economy is seriously underplayed.”</p>
<p>Flip it to:<br />
“Small business is the lifeblood of the UK economy, and it deserves the very best support.”</p>
<p>Make sure your statement doesn’t become:<br />
“I service small business better than anyone”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do some customer research to get your tone of voice right for your manifesto.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What matters to your customers?</li>
<li>How does your approach make things better for them?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can then find the intersection of your principles or values and those of your clients. Making these a manifesto feature or a ‘sticky’ service goal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all my reading and exploring of the range of manifesto&#8217;s I am going to lock myself away for a few hours and refine our purpose led mission statement into a manifesto. I am liking this approach to help guide us in the next phase of our business existence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best of luck with your manifesto or purpose driven mission statement for your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>You get what you pay for.</h2>
<h4>You don’t know what you don’t know until you experience something different.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Late last year I was introduced to the amazing world of eyelash extensions. Instantly a convert I had my re-fills religiously every 3 weeks and experienced the benefits of no mascara, no morning-after smudge. Not to mention the compliments, which we love lets not lie!</p>
<p>In late April I visited Bali and considered having them filled as I heard they were half the price there.</p>
<p>I can see you already shaking your head and saying to yourself, “Don’t do it, what are you thinking?!” In my defense, I did get a recommendation for a salon. How do you qualify a recommendation is a very valid question.</p>
<p>However you would be correct, I had a semi-ok experience except for the freak-out mid session when my right eye was glued shut! I did think they looked thicker but that was all I thought at the time.</p>
<p>I returned to my lovely lady in Bayside, at Touch Body and Soul several weeks later and find out what a hatchet job I’ve received and discover we have to either start from scratch or go the slow process of waiting for the duds to drop out.</p>
<p>Hayley tells me how lucky I am that I escaped the eyelid infections (I do a search on Google images) but I also still don&#8217;t realise how good a job Touch do until I share my Bali horror with others.</p>
<h4>Lessons from life #12054888.</h4>
<p>Consider what you are saving when you get a deal. When asking how much should a website cost be sure you compare all the features of the service to see if there are hidden costs or value add benefits that will save you in the long run.</p>
<p>In thinking about this experience I realise that cost is always a factor in deciding which solution to go with. The costs can range from free to over $30k.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This article hopefully will help put all design &amp; development options on a level playing field so you can make the best choice for you.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Check what happens when you sign up for a free option. If they take your credit card when does it start to be billed? After you add 2 pages? After 6 months? Ask if you can’t find the information on their FAQ’s</li>
<li>What is the domain name? If it looks anything like this mybusiness.cheapwebsite.com.au stay away.
<ol>
<li>Because you are sending traffic to their domain, their ranking improves and you gain no good Google Juice.</li>
<li>Your business brand is being hijacked if it’s connected to another brand</li>
<li>It’s confusing to a customer as to what you are all about</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Is there an SEO component to help you building on your Google ranking and movement up the pages?
<ol>
<li>Can you control what goes into the SEO built-in portion of each page.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>What are the hidden charges?</li>
<li>If it starts as free and then you wish to upgrade to a paid version can you move the data? Some companies won’t let you move files, they lock the copy / images / pages.</li>
<li>Will they have advertisements on your site or footer? Unrelated blatant marketing of their brand? You want complete control over your brand on your site.</li>
<li>Companies can disappear at any time. A recent customers website was hacked, when we looked into it the supplier was actually hacked too and no record of them. She had to start from scratch. If her site was a sub-address to theirs (cheapwebsites.mysmallbusiness.com.au ) then that would be gone too.</li>
<li>Malware can appear on your site because their level of security is not good enough, and you can’t control that. You are at the mercy of their security. Really really important you look at that.</li>
<li>Size of bandwith offered on the free or cheap versions. This means the amount of data that can be transferred from where the files are stored (hosting) to the viewer.</li>
<li>What is the size of storage, meaning how much information or size of files on your site. This will impact images, pages and experience for visitor. When you reach your limit the company will ask you to pay for more space.</li>
<li>How flexible are the design options? Do you want to look like a cookie cutter website?</li>
<li>What are the options for growth? Adding on a shop or a membership section? Adding in pop-ups and embedded forms for email capture? How easy is it to link with an email manager like Mailchimp so you can email market to grow your business?</li>
<li>What is customer service like? Do they offer 24hour live chat or support tickets with a 12 hour response KPI? What after sales service is offered or guarantee on their work.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck and reach out if you have any questions about an option you are considering.</p>
