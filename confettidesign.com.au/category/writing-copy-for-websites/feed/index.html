										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve tried your best to create your own website; you have labored for hours over the words to capture your visitor&#8217;s interest, you have added some pretty images. You are also getting good traffic to your website, but you wonder why most of these leads don’t convert and they leave after only a few seconds of visiting a page on your site. You will be rubbing your head asking why aren&#8217;t visitors staying on my website?</p>
<p>According to the Nielsen Norman Group, (leaders in user experience research) most users stick around less than 59 seconds. This means that if you are unable to capture your user’s attention in less than a minute, you’ve lost them. Frightening when you think of the effort already put into your small business website!</p>
<p>I’ve pulled together a few reasons why your visitors don’t stay on your website for long and what you might do to rectify the situation. Keep in mind with marketing, there is no absolute definative answer, it is a task of test and measure. Try addressing a few of these issues below then monitor the changes to behaviour in your analytics dashboard. (Just on this: if you don&#8217;t have analytics please do that first, you have invested in a website, respect that expenditure by monitoring what happens on it, who comes to it, where they come from)</p>
<p>You don’t need to do all of the suggestions below at once. And it goes without saying try the cheapest and quickest ideas first, test it out, observe results then try another idea.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your website design is not engaging or talking ‘to’ your customer</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The truth is we all judge the book by its cover, you are naive to think otherwise and losing opportunities. Design matters and clarity of message is important. Appealing to your customer is vital, if you can look at your site through their eyes is a good start.</p>
<p>If your site still looks like a design of 1992, or it’s not responding on a table or phone, then you actually do need to invest the dollars in a professional makeover design. If your site is responsive but not sure if it’s the design that is outdated or how to fix it, take advantage of a website and brand review. There are quite a few automated ones online and we also offer the service <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/website-audit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEBSITE AUDIT</a>.<br />
Benefit of a review is you get the perspective of a visitor, then you can try to fix the issues yourself before starting a complete re-design.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Your website content is difficult to read</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your design is not only about your choice of colors, graphics or images, but the colors of your text and background determine how easy your visitors can read and digest the content on your website. The simple truth is your website won’t convert well if it can’t be easily read. There are no particular fonts to use and which to avoid, however when in doubt use one font in 2 -3 sizes or thickness on light backgrounds. The next big tip is to break up all sections of copy with a hierarchy of really important summary headings, a secondary sub-heading then the body of the copy. This breaks the information into bit sized pieces for the visitor.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Your customer can’t find what they want quick enough on your website</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This could be because you are trying to get them to act to too many calls-to-action or they can’t find anything clear to act on. You can fix this easily.</p>
<ol>
<li> the navigation might be using silly names to describe pages so it’s not clear where to go – change to simple descriptions</li>
<li> you have no clear and highly visible buttons or offerings that ask the visitor to do anything. This could be CALL US, BOOK A FREE QUOTE, DOWNLOAD OUR AWESOME GUIDE, VIEW ALL SERVICES.</li>
<li> keep language simple. Using convoluted language to appear intelligent firstly comes off annoying and secondly the visitor still can’t find what you do, how you help them and what they should do next</li>
<li> no clear services within the top section of the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>The core learning here is to keep the language simple, spell out what you do, how you do it and who you help in as few words as possible. Finally include one call to action you wish the visitor to take.</p>
<p>E.g Heading: We offer Osteopathy to reduce muscle pain in sports people, elderly, pregnancy and children.<br />
Followed by a button: MAKE A BOOKING</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>The videos on your website auto-play</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There is nothing that will make your visitor leave your business website within seconds of arriving than a video that auto-plays. Today’s digital-savvy customers now prefer to be the boss; they like to choose when they wish to consume online content. A quick way to get users off your site is by blasting unwanted content at them without their consent. A follow up to this is to keep your videos to less than 2 minutes, get to the point and keep the focus on who you help, how and why with as little about you as possible. Keep the old marketing adage ‘what’s in it for me’ at the forefront.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong video is a huge strategy to keep people on your site. Video will also help develop a connection with your visitor quicker than words, keep it short, show your personality and focus on solving their problems. Video testimonials are also extremely powerful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Add your customer testimonials for credibility</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>63% of customers will more likely to purchase from a site with reviews. (see full report <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/9366-ecommerce-consumer-reviews-why-you-need-them-and-how-to-use-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here )</a><br />
Use testimonials for social proof, overcoming barriers to purchase, shows real experience of working with you. Testimonials have bonus benefits as search engine spiders like fresh new content and a review is a great and easy way to fee the spiders.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, there we have 5 tips to help you keep your visitors on your site and converting more of them.  The good news is that you are getting traffic so high five for that, but now is the time to see how you can improve conversions and hopefully we &#8216;ve given you a couple of fixes to answer your question why aren&#8217;t people staying on my website that you can enact yourself.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past year I have designed a couple of landing pages and while doing so I collated a list of do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts.</p>
<p>What is a landing page you may ask? A landing page is the page that visitors see after clicking on your Facebook ad, promotional email or if you provided a link in a traditional marketing piece. It can be a specific page on your website or a separate page created exclusively for search engines. A landing page is designed to direct visitors to take a specific action, such as making a purchase, completing a registration, or subscribing to your mailing list.</p>
<p>When I design a website I spend a lot of time considering the client, their personality, their brand and equally their customer. Every design element must meet these 2 criteria. The desired result is for the pages to connect with the visitor so they will feel trust and thus pick the phone or act.</p>
<p>When it comes to designing a landing page or sales page we have to also consider the key elements to convert a visitor into am more targeted action, the action of signing up and paying on the spot.</p>
<p>The 2 of these goals may sound the same but when it comes to design, copy and photography they are subtly different. This is no better time to employ a copywriter with landing page expertise.</p>
<h3>Lets take a look at key elements of how to design a landing page that converts:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Headline</strong><br />
For a high converting landing page, the headline must be very visible, the first thing your visitor sees and it must offer a benefit. Keep your headline succinct, straight to the point and create urgency to the visitor acts then and there.<br />
Ensure it is the same headline you use in the ads or links that get your customer to this page. They acted on a certain headline best not to confuse them into thinking they have been directed to an incorrect page by being tricky with your headlines.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Supporting sub-headline</strong><br />
A sub-headline will give people a reason to read your entire copy, instead of skimming or scanning it. Keep repeating this sub-headline to reinforce the benefit and to give context to the attention grabbing main headline. Use simply language.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>One focal point</strong><br />
The brain processes visual information quicker than text. Just as an artist or interior designer always has one feature you notice more so should your landing page. Always add a visual focus to your landing page, such as your headshot, the product or a short video of benefits.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>One call to action</strong><br />
The purpose of a landing page it to entice a visitor to take ONE specific action. The action needs to be highly visible as a button to subscribe, download, purchase, share or a form to complete. More options you offer of actions the less you will see convert. The language needs to be simple and clear. The colour you choose as the button may need to be tested. <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/what-are-the-best-converting-cta-button-colours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a> is another blog about the use of colour to help.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Remove distractions</strong><br />
A landing or sales page there is no navigation, no clutter, menu’s, links or extra buttons. The purpose is for the visitor to see the benefits, identify as someone who needs the solution you offer and then act on that message. You don’t want them navigation away or delaying with confusing messaging.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">In particular these are other things you should keep off your page:<br />
a. links to other parts of your sites such as “about” or “contact”<br />
b. any pictures or images that don’t relate to the offer; these will only serve as distractions<br />
c. small sized font, must be at least 14 px<br />
d. any links along the lines of “click here to subscribe” or “click here to read more.” If you can’t cram all your content into the upper fold of your landing page, just let the user scroll down. Scrolling is almost always better than clicking to the next page.<br />
e. scary forms with unnecessary fields such as “title” or “fax”<br />
f. “clear fields” button</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are always exceptions and you usually can’t copy best practices to use on your site, but this advice given here should be your starting point. Get the essentials in place first, and tweak from there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Customer/client testimonials or social proof</strong><br />
Add in testimonials to prove what you are offering. Testimonials can also overcome barriers to purchase. See my blog <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/10-tips-get-powerful-testimonials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a> for more on that.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Maintain your brand</strong><br />
Keep your landing pages looking as similar to your website as possible. Your brand is still communicating all the principles of you and connecting in the same way we are simply guiding them to act more definitively on a sales page. Keep the same colors, font – the overall look and feel of your main site. This helps to enforce the brand awareness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Length<br />
</strong>Long or short? Answer these questions: How much money are you asking for or how complex is the decision making process? How much emotion is involved? Or what level of anxiety is involved? The rule of thumb is the more you ask for the longer the page. The greater investment emotionally or time or financially the more you will need to include. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Testing</strong><br />
You will need to always test what colours, copy and images you have used. There is no magic wand as your customer will respond to your offering differently to others. Here are a couple of guides to help you understand A/B testing:<br />
1. <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/the-ultimate-guide-to-a-b-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ultimate Guide To A/B Testing</a><br />
2. <a href="http://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-ab-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is A/B Testing?</a></p>
<p>We have identified the 9 key principles in designing your landing page now finally ensure you don’t break these 2 rules before you go live:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"># 1. Never send traffic to your home page<br />
To get people to your sales page you will need to market it on social media or traditional print or email marketing. The purpose of the sales page is create the urgency and get the customer to act, therefore you never drive traffic onto your website’s home page. Your homepage has a navigation where the visitor will go wandering and can easily exit before finding your offer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">#2: Make it relevant to YOUR customer<br />
We have just seconds before a visitor makes a decision about whether our offer is useful or relevant. They will click away if they can’t find what they want or if it doesn’t entice easily without effort on their part. Confusion or miss-targeting will result in abandonment and no sales or sign ups.</p>
<p>Rather than let that happen, make the few seconds you have their attention count and answer the questions that are on their mind:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Does this place have what I am looking for?</em><br />
<em>Do they understand me?</em><br />
<em>Is there enough information?</em><br />
<em>Can I trust this person / business or product?</em><br />
<em>How long &amp; much will this all take?</em></p>
<p>Your landing page must entice visitors to stay and complete the desired action for conversion, whether it’s filling out a subscription form or buying a product. Before you send your request off to your designer to get working on your landing page get the copy right. Sit down and create it on a blank page with a pen and map it out and answer these 2 questions.</p>
<p>This will save you lots of time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1: Who is my target audience?<br />
</strong>Make sure the landing page talks to a specific audience. Know the problem, the need and want your target audience has. You want to write the words with a particular person in mind.<br />
<span style="color: #cb0044;"><em>If aren’t too sure about this then you my <a style="color: #cb0044;" href="https://confettidesign.com.au/starting-a-small-business/">Clarity Process </a>is a must. Read about the effectiveness here in identifying your competitive advantage and defining who your target customer is.</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2: What do I want them to do?<br />
</strong>Define the desire action. This is the one action people should take when landing on the page. What is the sole outcome you want for this page? Opt-in to build your list, purchase a product, attend a webinar?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3: What is my message?<br />
</strong>You know your audience, the problem they have and the solution you can offer, write a simple and an easily understood message. This message will need to be tested but you have to start somewhere but above all else be straight forward, keep the tricky language out!</p>
<p>Once you have these you can either send it to a designer, like me! Or do it yourself by following the 7 key principles above. Good luck and don’t forget to test and measure!<br />
Below is an info graph to give you a visual representation of how the principles in action.</p>

<p><span style="color: #cb0044;"><strong>What do I do?</strong></span> Detail what you can do to solve their problems, what they recieve.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #cb0044;">What can others expect if they work with me?</span></strong> Explain the process you take to deliver the product or service. People don’t like surprises unless they are a nice surprise and outside of the delivery of what they pay for. Leave the surprises to the extras not the mandatories. You can read about managing customers expectations here.</p>
<p><span style="color: #cb0044;"><strong>How can I represent my personal and business brand visually?</strong></span> Select images that reinforce your personal style and business brand messaging.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #cb0044;">What tone is suitable for my About page?</span></strong> Is your brand fun and frivolous, serious or nurturing? Use language, tone and words that are in alignment with your service persona. Consistency represents reliability; it’s appealing and shows you are a professional.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.canmoremakeupartist.com/about/">http://www.canmoremakeupartist.com</a>  the text isn&#8217;t the focus here for me, it&#8217;s the confidence, authority and trust instilled by her associations and recommendations. Listing theses in a visual list of icons of the organisations is all thats needed and the photo of her at work for you to feel confident of her abilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.katenorthrup.com/about-contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.katenorthrup.com/about-contact/</a> appeals to what you may want out of life and how she can help you gain that.</p>

<p><a href="http://elsaisaac.com/about-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://elsaisaac.com/about-me/</a> her page gives you a real sense of who she is and how she can help you.</p>
<p>As your About Me page is so important, if you find it too overwhelming I recommend using a professional copywriter. It can be very challenging to write about yourself and be succinct and blow your own trumpet at the same time as sound humble!</p>
<p><strong>Now you&#8217;ve mastered the word, don&#8217;t forget the images</strong></p>
<p>The other crucial element in your About Me page is the photography of you. Whether you are the face of your business or not you must, must, must firstly use a professional photographer to take your About Me page photos. I talk more about the importance of your personal branding in this article <a href="http://contentmagazine.com.au/2014/12/personal-style-part-brand-saying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly ensure you have a professional do your make-up and hair for the shoot. I recently had to gently push a client to invest in this part of her shoot and having seen the photos, she now appreciates the difference it made. She looked amazing and she loved the experience of seeing herself look so polished. Make-up needs to be a stronger than you would wear in real life so it can be a bit overwhelming, but the effect is fabulous. I have a list of professionals that I use and can recommend. They all do specials throughout the year or particular days of the week, so don&#8217;t be afraid to ask.</p>
<p><strong>Final Note</strong></p>
<p>On a final note remember most importantly that a good About Us page means nothing if you don’t have your own domain name and web host. If you are using a free blog like Tumblr or Blogger you are growing a brand that you don’t fully own or control. Do you wish to put your brand at risk?</p>

			<p>How to maintain a steady stream of customers &#8211;<br />
A 6-part series</p>
<p>This is article #1 of a series of 6 that will be posted over the coming weeks that provides an insight into modern emotional-based marketing.</p>
<p>In this first article we focus on understanding your customer.</p>
<p>At the heart of every small business is the challenge of how to maintain a steady stream of customers through your door or to your website. While other parts of your business can be put on the shelf for ‘another day’, if we don’t dedicate time to business development our business will either stagnate or die!</p>
<p>Now that is not why you went into business is it, to limp awkwardly along our path of dreamed success? You, like me started this venture because you craved your own sanctuary, to be the true master of your destiny, share your passion and be successful while doing so.</p>
<p>If you worry about getting more customers to your business, you are not alone. The stress and worry of getting enough good customers is the number one reason small business owners lose sleep.<br />
Don’t get me wrong I am not advocating sleazy desperate buy-from-me email marketing, this upcoming series of tips is centered in emotional marketing.<br />
Emotional marketing is about connecting with your customers, moving people and it is essentially marketing from the heart.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">In traditional marketing this is known as your target market. </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">The difference with modern emotional marketing is that you need to go deep into the psychology of your customer. You put yourself into their shoes and empathise with their fears, worries, problems and challenges and instantly you see how your product or service solves these for them.</span></strong></p>
<p>By delving into their minds you have at your disposal a perspective that can drive your branding, communication style and visuals. These design and language choices indicate to your customer that you understand them and are offering a tailored solution. In effect you will make your customer say ‘that’s exactly what I need, this business knows me!’</p>
<p>Start with demographics, traits and then delve into the psychographics. Here are a few questions to get you onto the right track.</p>
<p><em>• What is their age?<br />
• Where do they live and why?<br />
• What is their job and why?<br />
• What do they drive and why?<br />
• What are their hobbies?<br />
• What magazines and books do they read?<br />
• What are their favourite movies and TV shows?<br />
• What are their values and principles they live by?<br />
• What income to they earn?<br />
• What is their favourite food?<br />
• Where is their fantasy holiday destination?<br />
• If money were no object what would they do?<br />
• What are their greatest fears in relation to your products or services?<br />
• How would they feel if you solved these fears for them?<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">You want to understand this person so clearly that you know what they think, feel, love, wish and fear. You also want to know how amazing they feel when your product solves their problem or answers a question.</span></strong></p>
<p>You may offer multiple products or services in your business and thus it requires multiple customer profiles.</p>
<p>Understanding who you are selling to, or who will benefit most from your products / services, narrows down where you spend your marketing, networking and development efforts.</p>
<p>The clarity the exercise brings is valuable and powerful. You may find this a hard exercise to do but it is well worth the effort. All my website clients have needed to do this exercise before we started the design process as it is so vital to creating an effective website that connects on an emotional level to their customers.</p>
<p>Good luck! If you like the sound of emotional marketing I offer business coaching that goes provides you great clarity in your business activity. Contact me <a title="CONTACT ME" href="https://confettidesign.com.au/contact-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to discuss.</p>
