										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many small business owners when starting out get caught up in the pretty stuff, like a logo and a website. Don’t get me wrong this is my core business so I know they are important but what is key is what you want these ‘pretty’ things to communicate? This article will help to explain what is the difference between a logo and a brand.</p>
<p>We can all agree having a logo is a key element to effectively marketing your business – just look at Virgin or fashion houses like Chanel, but what many people don’t consider is the messages or emotions you want to evoke in a prospective customer before you start the designing process. The brand is what people feel about your business, the impression they are left with, the reputation is built into the brand personality not simply the logo.<br />
The reason you want to make this distinction is that you will be able to achieve results that make a difference to your bottom line by determining the message behind your brand. You&#8217;ve heard the phrase, &#8220;A picture says a thousand words.&#8221; This is so true of your branding. The first thing some of your customers will come in contact with regarding your company is your brand. This first impression will last forever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Brand is What People Say about You When you’re Not Around.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>When developing a new brand or reviewing how effective your existing brand is, there are some questions to ask yourself: </strong><br />
• What do we want to be known for?</p>
<ul>o Is it sophistication, quickness, strength, proven results, expert knowledge, easy of service, creativity</ul>
<p>• What core values underpin who we are as a company / business?</p>
<ul>o Integrity, honesty, care, approachable, fun</ul>
<p>• What emotions do we want to evoke in our prospective customer?<br />
o Trust, relief, satisfaction, commitment, excitement,</p>
<ul>• Who do we want to attract as a customer? (be specific and niche)</ul>
<p>o All single mothers of toddlers living anywhere in Australia who also work part-time and are committed to being strong and healthy but don’t have time to go to gym</p>
<ul>• Does our target market identify with your current brand? (Ask them in a survey)</ul>
<p><strong>How do these impact the design of a brand?</strong><br />
A businesses brand elements; colours, typography, visuals, logo, work together to identify and distinguish the brand in the consumers&#8217; mind. Your brand personality leaves an impression that either engages the consumer or doesn’t. What you aim for is a brand identity that communicates your unique voice and that voice speaks directly to YOUR customer. In order to know how to do this you must research and think about exactly HOW you want to be perceived and WHO you want to serve in your business then make sure these actually match, their worlds collide so-to-speak!</p>
<p>Thinking about your customer as well as what is unique about your service will help your designer determine the following; </p>
<ul>o the type images to use in the website, insta feed or marketing collateral</ul>
<ul>o the colours and colour intensity used in your brand</ul>
<ul>o the font selection</ul>
<ul>o the scale of the logo</ul>
<ul>o elements used in creating a logo such as lines, repetition, organic shapes versus geometric</ul>
<p>All these elements will help to create the perfect brand persona for your business that also attracts that perfect customer. We would also highly recommend you consider how you present yourself in person. As an extension of your brand are you presenting a consistent first impression? Reach out to as stylist to get some advice on this. </p>
<p>One incredible unexpected outcome about doing all this &#8216;thinking or strategy&#8217; work is that it makes further decisions very easy to make, giving you a feeling of confidence, freedom and a sense of ease.<br />
To explain, if all this ground working thinking and decisions are made about you, target market means the following is pretty easy:</p>
<ul>o what style of photography is needed</p>
<ul>o packaging or products or your &#8216;un-boxing&#8217; experience</p>
<ul>o what type of content is important to attract your customer and gain social traction</p>
<ul>o where to network</p>
<ul>o where to advertise</p>
<ul>o what to support </p>
<ul>o which physical groups to join or Facebook groups or if this is where your customer is at all</p>
<ul>o what to say at your networking events to describe your business </p>
<p>Essentially with all the foundations of values and target market secured you are free to position yourself and market without stress and indecision. </p>

			<p>When we create an engaging and captivating website that attracts perfect match customers, images are a huge part of the process. I thought the best way share the importance of the right images is to talk to a professional photographer.</p>
<p>This is part 1 of a 3 part series about select images for your website when you are designing a successful marketing website tool.</p>
<p>Let me introduce Fi Mims from Fi Mims Photography branding photographer, based in Melbourne, Australia. Fi is out go-to photographer for our clients and after reading this interview you will understand why! She is passionate, creative, a joy to work with, and gets results every time.</p>
<p>See some of her images below for her clients and also our clients. We encourage clients to get not just a branding image but also make their services stand out by using images of them at work. It is a very easy way to stand out from your competitors and to connect with a website visitor.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<ol>
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">Fear or anxiety can seriously ruin a shoot. Most people will let their anxiety come through in their expression, how do you help eliminate this as the images you take are always so beautiful?</li>
</ol>
<p>As the photographer my first responsibility is to make sure the person in front of my camera is comfortable, and I think this is something you just get better at with time. If someone is nervous I’ll talk to them and ask them questions – about their work, their family, their recent holiday. I pick topics I think will either distract them from the camera, or light them up and put a sparkle in their eye! And if all else fails I tell silly jokes</p>
<p>The other important thing I do is help my clients arrive at their shoot feeling prepared. To do this I send them questionnaires and pre-session guides. In many cases we also talk at length on the phone so I can answer questions or respond to any fears they have around the shoot – common ones are what to wear, what to bring. I expect clients to arrive nervous, but if they can also arrive feeling like they are as prepared as possible then that’s half my job done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">Is there a go to pose people can practise at home before coming to a shoot? Do you even recommend this, I mean should someone practice their poses or expressions before the shoot at all?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it’s a good idea to know how you want to come across in your photos. If my clients have seen images they love I encourage them to share these with me via an inspiration board on Pinterest, as that way I can use them as a guide to capture the look or feel they want to achieve. But when it comes to posing I think it’s best to leave this up to your photographer on the day – after all, that’s one of the reasons why you hired them! Your photographer should have the skill to pose you in a way that is flattering, and to bring our your natural expressions. Poses or positions that feel comfortable may not always look great through the perspective of the camera lens, so just relax and let your photographer guide you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What is your top tip to rock any photoshoot even for those people that hate having their photo taken?</li>
</ol>
<p>My one tip would probably be to book a professional hair and makeup artist, because stepping in front of the camera knowing you look amazing will help your confidence enormously. I see this all the time with my clients! I work with a great team of professional makeup artists who will meet women at the studio before their session upon request. Not only do they make them look and feel great, but it also gives them an hour to relax and just be calm before their session – it’s such a great way to walk into a shoot and the women that do it, love it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What should someone bring to a photoshoot?</li>
</ol>
<p>Plenty of outfit options so we can pick and choose what works best on the day, props relevant to their brand if they want to include these, and a clear idea of what they want to achieve through their images. And a sense of fun! You have nothing to lose when you step in front of the camera, so just enjoy yourself and relax as much as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">Would you recommend a stylist to come to a shoot?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the more you can invest in your session the better. So if you think you would benefit from either working with a stylist before your session, or having one on hand during the shoot, then go for it. More and more of my clients are working with personal stylists before their session to help them select what to wear, and the result is always great. What you wear is an important element to any image, and my clients struggle with this more than anything else. Those that work with stylists before their photo shoot always arrive feeling more confident because they don’t have to worry about how they look.</p>
<p>You really just have to assess what you want from your session and decide whether a stylist will be a worthwhile investment, or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What is the difference between a headshot and a branding portrait?</li>
</ol>
<p>A headshot is a photo of someone that focuses on their face, and is cropped to just include their head and shoulders. It’s an image so people know what you look like. A branding portrait is much more than this. A branding portrait should tell a story. It should communicate a person’s personality and their brand, and help customers connect with them. In today’s competitive market, branding portraits are a great way to stand out and make sure you get noticed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li class="text-pink text-bigger">What’s the #1 mistake you see women entrepreneurs (or men) make with their photography? (This is my way of asking what really chaps your a** when it comes to photography you see online!)</li>
</ol>
<p>I suppose I get most frustrated when I see people using poor quality images over professional photography. How are people supposed to take your brand seriously when you don’t? I also get disappointed when I see stock photography used to represent brands that would be so much better represented by authentic images that show the business owner and what they do. Professional photography is an investment, but it doesn’t have to be a huge one. And when you think of the value it can offer to a business in terms of lifting its brand profile, communicating a message and attracting the right customers, there is no question as to whether or not it’s a worthwhile one.</p>
<p>People are visual beings, and we only have a few seconds to grab their attention and impress them, so great images are the best investment you can make in yourself and your business!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know that colors play a large role in our marketing efforts, but have you ever taken a closer look at how color may be affecting your bottom line?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, color has a powerful influence on our emotions and decision making abilities, not to mention our first impressions of everything from a logo to a landing page.</p>
<p>Have you considered what are the best converting CTA button colours and headline text?</p>
<p>Here are some key color areas to think about when designing your landing pages:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Your brand<br />
</strong>It is vital that you consider your branding when selecting colours for CTA buttons and text. The page needs to be appealing and easy to read.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Colours<br />
</strong>Colours on the colour wheel can be grouped and analysed by emotion, divided into passive vs active colours.&nbsp;Active colors are the brighter colours, from vibrant green round to bright red. They tend to excite both the mind and body and can be sources of energy and creativity. These are generally used as CTA buttons.<br />
Passive colors are the more neutral and muted colors&nbsp;and tend to increase mental focus and have a calming effect. These include dark green round to deep plum and red. You will find text more often used in these colours.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Colour-Wheel.png" rel="attachment wp-att-3081"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3081" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Colour-Wheel.png" alt="Colour-Wheel-Confetti-Design" width="526" height="524"/></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Background colour<br />
</strong>When using a solid color on your landing page background, make sure it won’t interfere with the text. And if it’s a deep color, make sure the text contrasts well. Mostly use a rule of squinting and see if the main headline jumps out. Easiest choice is to keep to whitespace to draw your viewer’s eye to your CTA. <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/how-to-design-a-landing-page-that-converts/" target="_blank">Design a clean landing page int</a>ended to create a flow towards your CTA.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Call-to-action colors</strong><br />
In choosing your colors for calls to action, consider what each color represents to you, your brand and how consumers will perceive them.</p>
<p>Try using this tool to select colours–&nbsp;<a href="http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF" target="_blank">Paletton Tool</a></p>
<p>Or this one is also great for guiding you in finding colour palates &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/?base=2&amp;rule=Analogous&amp;selected=2&amp;name=My%20Color%20Theme&amp;mode=rgb&amp;rgbvalues=1,0.23426724137910926,0.050000000000000044,0.91,0.08711027298838832,0.04550000000000004,1,0,0.33497536945833417,0.91,0.04550000000000004,0.7673362068969265,0.8264218540076399,0.050000000000000044,1&amp;swatchOrder=0,1,2,3,4" target="_blank">Adobe Colour Tool</a></p>
<p>You may need Hex colour or RGB colours for these tools or for using Canva so this is great one:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.color-hex.com/color/cb0044" target="_blank">HEX to RGB &amp; CMYK Tool</a></p>
<p>As a rule use contrasting colours on the colour wheel to those in your brand so it stands out. You may be limited a bit by your branding colours therefore if your brand is without a contrast colour, as they are all of a similar colour hue, then plot one of those colours in the tool and see what comes as a contrast to pick for your CTA buttons. Always keep in mind your brand, your customer’s tastes and good sense!</p>
<p>This article is quite useful in the argument around colour choice and ‘red as a CTA button is always more effective&#8217;&nbsp;<a href="http://conversionxl.com/which-color-converts-the-best/" target="_blank">Which Color Converts The Best, by Conversion XL</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day the success will be measured with testing and trying it out on your market with your copy and product. Good luck. x</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past year I have designed a couple of landing pages and while doing so I collated a list of do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts.</p>
<p>What is a landing page you may ask? A landing page is the page that visitors see after clicking on your Facebook ad, promotional email or if you provided a link in a traditional marketing piece. It can be a specific page on your website or a separate page created exclusively for search engines. A landing page is designed to direct visitors to take a specific action, such as making a purchase, completing a registration, or subscribing to your mailing list.</p>
<p>When I design a website I spend a lot of time considering the client, their personality, their brand and equally their customer. Every design element must meet these 2 criteria. The desired result is for the pages to connect with the visitor so they will feel trust and thus pick the phone or act.</p>
<p>When it comes to designing a landing page or sales page we have to also consider the key elements to convert a visitor into am more targeted action, the action of signing up and paying on the spot.</p>
<p>The 2 of these goals may sound the same but when it comes to design, copy and photography they are subtly different. This is no better time to employ a copywriter with landing page expertise.</p>
<h3>Lets take a look at key elements of how to design a landing page that converts:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Headline</strong><br />
For a high converting landing page, the headline must be very visible, the first thing your visitor sees and it must offer a benefit. Keep your headline succinct, straight to the point and create urgency to the visitor acts then and there.<br />
Ensure it is the same headline you use in the ads or links that get your customer to this page. They acted on a certain headline best not to confuse them into thinking they have been directed to an incorrect page by being tricky with your headlines.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Supporting sub-headline</strong><br />
A sub-headline will give people a reason to read your entire copy, instead of skimming or scanning it. Keep repeating this sub-headline to reinforce the benefit and to give context to the attention grabbing main headline. Use simply language.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>One focal point</strong><br />
The brain processes visual information quicker than text. Just as an artist or interior designer always has one feature you notice more so should your landing page. Always add a visual focus to your landing page, such as your headshot, the product or a short video of benefits.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>One call to action</strong><br />
The purpose of a landing page it to entice a visitor to take ONE specific action. The action needs to be highly visible as a button to subscribe, download, purchase, share or a form to complete. More options you offer of actions the less you will see convert. The language needs to be simple and clear. The colour you choose as the button may need to be tested. <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/what-are-the-best-converting-cta-button-colours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a> is another blog about the use of colour to help.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Remove distractions</strong><br />
A landing or sales page there is no navigation, no clutter, menu’s, links or extra buttons. The purpose is for the visitor to see the benefits, identify as someone who needs the solution you offer and then act on that message. You don’t want them navigation away or delaying with confusing messaging.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">In particular these are other things you should keep off your page:<br />
a. links to other parts of your sites such as “about” or “contact”<br />
b. any pictures or images that don’t relate to the offer; these will only serve as distractions<br />
c. small sized font, must be at least 14 px<br />
d. any links along the lines of “click here to subscribe” or “click here to read more.” If you can’t cram all your content into the upper fold of your landing page, just let the user scroll down. Scrolling is almost always better than clicking to the next page.<br />
e. scary forms with unnecessary fields such as “title” or “fax”<br />
f. “clear fields” button</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are always exceptions and you usually can’t copy best practices to use on your site, but this advice given here should be your starting point. Get the essentials in place first, and tweak from there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Customer/client testimonials or social proof</strong><br />
Add in testimonials to prove what you are offering. Testimonials can also overcome barriers to purchase. See my blog <a href="https://confettidesign.com.au/10-tips-get-powerful-testimonials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a> for more on that.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Maintain your brand</strong><br />
Keep your landing pages looking as similar to your website as possible. Your brand is still communicating all the principles of you and connecting in the same way we are simply guiding them to act more definitively on a sales page. Keep the same colors, font – the overall look and feel of your main site. This helps to enforce the brand awareness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Length<br />
</strong>Long or short? Answer these questions: How much money are you asking for or how complex is the decision making process? How much emotion is involved? Or what level of anxiety is involved? The rule of thumb is the more you ask for the longer the page. The greater investment emotionally or time or financially the more you will need to include. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Testing</strong><br />
You will need to always test what colours, copy and images you have used. There is no magic wand as your customer will respond to your offering differently to others. Here are a couple of guides to help you understand A/B testing:<br />

<p>We have identified the 9 key principles in designing your landing page now finally ensure you don’t break these 2 rules before you go live:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"># 1. Never send traffic to your home page<br />
To get people to your sales page you will need to market it on social media or traditional print or email marketing. The purpose of the sales page is create the urgency and get the customer to act, therefore you never drive traffic onto your website’s home page. Your homepage has a navigation where the visitor will go wandering and can easily exit before finding your offer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">#2: Make it relevant to YOUR customer<br />
We have just seconds before a visitor makes a decision about whether our offer is useful or relevant. They will click away if they can’t find what they want or if it doesn’t entice easily without effort on their part. Confusion or miss-targeting will result in abandonment and no sales or sign ups.</p>
<p>Rather than let that happen, make the few seconds you have their attention count and answer the questions that are on their mind:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Does this place have what I am looking for?</em><br />
<em>Do they understand me?</em><br />
<em>Is there enough information?</em><br />
<em>Can I trust this person / business or product?</em><br />
<em>How long &amp; much will this all take?</em></p>
<p>Your landing page must entice visitors to stay and complete the desired action for conversion, whether it’s filling out a subscription form or buying a product. Before you send your request off to your designer to get working on your landing page get the copy right. Sit down and create it on a blank page with a pen and map it out and answer these 2 questions.</p>
<p>This will save you lots of time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1: Who is my target audience?<br />
</strong>Make sure the landing page talks to a specific audience. Know the problem, the need and want your target audience has. You want to write the words with a particular person in mind.<br />
<span style="color: #cb0044;"><em>If aren’t too sure about this then you my <a style="color: #cb0044;" href="https://confettidesign.com.au/starting-a-small-business/">Clarity Process </a>is a must. Read about the effectiveness here in identifying your competitive advantage and defining who your target customer is.</em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2: What do I want them to do?<br />
</strong>Define the desire action. This is the one action people should take when landing on the page. What is the sole outcome you want for this page? Opt-in to build your list, purchase a product, attend a webinar?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3: What is my message?<br />
</strong>You know your audience, the problem they have and the solution you can offer, write a simple and an easily understood message. This message will need to be tested but you have to start somewhere but above all else be straight forward, keep the tricky language out!</p>
<p>Once you have these you can either send it to a designer, like me! Or do it yourself by following the 7 key principles above. Good luck and don’t forget to test and measure!<br />
Below is an info graph to give you a visual representation of how the principles in action.</p>
