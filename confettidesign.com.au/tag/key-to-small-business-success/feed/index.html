			<h5 class="">In Part 4 we consider the importance of knowing your customer to then research and uncover where they hang out so you know where and how to find customers for your business.</h5>
<p>For many of us starting out as small business owners we are a jack-of-all-trades, doing all manner of jobs; accounts, designer, writer, sales person, IT, customer service, cleaner, filing clerk, the roles go on.<br />
It can be quite a juggling act, exhilarating and yet exhausting. As the customers start to roll in there is a feeling of relief that our idea was truly a success. But it can’t stop there, even for the most successful, we still need to keep the marketing, talking, investing in activities that develop our sales pipeline or funnel.</p>
<p>In this 6-part series we have looked at a few areas of how to maintain a steady stream of customers. This piece is about your marketing focus being aimed exactly where your customers are both on and offline.</p>
<p>Another way to keep your sales funnel full is by being very efficient with your time. Understanding we want to work smarter not harder, consider where your special, unique customer ‘hangs out’.</p>
<p>This is not meant in as slang, but rather literally place yourself, either physically or online, where your customers spend their time. When we place ourselves, our brand and our products where our customers are present we are in prime position to be talked about, remembered, referred to others or to have our products purchased.</p>
<p>The way to figure this out if of course to know who your customer is intimately. If this is your first time reading my articles, first go <a title="HOW TO MAINTAIN A STEADY STREAM OF CUSTOMERS – A 6 PART SERIES: PART 1" href="https://confettidesign.com.au/how_to_maintain_a_steady_stream_of_customers/">here</a> to define your customer.<br />
Without this step completed, you could be spending your time in all the wrong places and marketing to people who don’t need your product, don’t get ‘you’ or what you are about, because as we know not everyone is going to be ‘our’ customer i.e. a big waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s an example:</strong></p>
<p>If you create highly designed, edgy, modern, musician inspired printed t-shirts and you currently sell online but also want to wholesale to a retailer. When considering the best location for a retailer it’s not going to be in a conservative suburb with an elderly demographic. Your most suitable location will be in a suburb with a younger demographic where there&#8217;s live music venues and good shopping strips and hip happening cafe&#8217;s. To get exposure you would consider Music Festivals or markets, advertising on JJJ , PBS or dressing staff in a groovy café. Consider you may have more than one type of market, your t-shirts may appeal to middle aged married men who want to re-live their youth, ask yourself where do they hang out on weekends? When &amp; where do they do their shopping? Does their wife shop for them, where does she hang out?</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s another example:</strong></p>
<p>If you want to open an upmarket hair salon aimed at middle aged women with disposable income. You would design the interiors with them in mind, subtle and sophisticated. You would play music not too loud or ‘heavy’. You would open it in a suburb where you have easy access to this kind of demographic.</p>
<p><strong>Think of every element of this demographic and ask yourself questions like:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• What is the age range for my target audience?<br />
• Where is my target audience located?<br />
• Are they male, female or both?<br />
• What are the occupations of my target audience?<br />
• What to they do in their spare time?<br />
• What does their day look like?<br />
• What are their movements?<br />
• Where to they go and how do they get there?</p>
<p>Once you have identified your customer’s behaviour you can use this to help you determine where they spend their time most.<br />
Now you can target your marketing activity in the right places to people who are really interested in what you have to offer.<br />
Depending on the type of business you are running, your locations will be either physical, online or a combination of both. Look for local publications and online communities where you can contribute articles or information to increase your exposure. Consider joint ventures that increase your profile to your target audience. Remember to ask questions regarding what is available, you never know unless you ask!</p>
<p><strong>Physical Location:</strong><br />
Those who have a physical business most commonly use physical locations to hang out with their customers. Research and look for events or places specific to your field that will host your customers.<br />
For example, the owner of a beauty salon going through this research will discover that they target their customer at local beauty expos, beauty warehouses, gyms, local cafes and Chamber of Commerce events, local street trader association events and even places like school fundraisers.</p>
<p><strong>Online Presence:</strong><br />
With the recent increase in the use of the internet, both physical and online companies can interact with their target audience online through social media platforms such as blogs, forums, Facebook groups, Instagram and so on. Online presence can make for a huge success in business growth, as has been proven by those who have taken to blogs and Instagram and have ended up with thousands of followers, majority of which now consume their product.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong>:<br />
Facebook, Instragram, Linked In, Google searches, Tumblr and Twitter are the popluar online mediums that you can use to hangout where your target customers do. Determine which one best suits your product / service and where your customer hangs out. A good way to research which is the best media for you is to see what the leaders in your industry are doing, then use that as a starting point.</p>
<p>Hashtags are a great place to attract your target consumer. Make your hashtags specific and people from all aspects of the globe will be able to find you.</p>
<p>For example: A health coach will find themselves joining Facebook groups of people wanting to get healthy, local community hubs online, online forums about being healthy, and can hashtag their particular health products or specialities.</p>
<p>Figuring out where your people are can be a bit of trial and error, however it is much more efficient use of your time. A great approach is to interact either in person or virtually by adding value to their lives with no expectation in return. This allows for trust to develop within your target market and builds your expertise. When the time comes you will be the forefront of their mind to purchase from you or refer you.</p>

			<p>Learning how to network for business effectively is a very powerful tool for growth. Effective networking is all about developing valuable relationships over time. It’s about growing a pool of people who know about and value what you do.</p>
<p>The benefit of a good network is it gives you resources, inspiration, information, and connection to potential clients and referrals. As a small business owner it’s an important element of my marketing mix to regularly scheduling networking activities that increase my exposure and contacts.</p>
<p>This week’s blog article provides 7 ways to make networking easier, especially if social occasions make you anxious like me. These tips will help prepare you so you can network like a pro even if you are an introvert or inexperienced.</p>
<p>Practical tips</p>
<p><em><strong>Practice on people you are comfortable with</strong></em> If the idea of approaching people you don&#8217;t know intimidates you, begin your networking efforts by seeking out familiar faces, such as relatives and friends, at school and sporting occasions. A series of successful conversations will make you more confident in the process.</p>
<p><em><strong>Body Language</strong></em> It’s important to make eye contact and remember people’s names, so practice until you perfect this. Not only is this good manners, it is an easy way to show people they matter and you have been paying attention. Smile a warm authentic smile: it puts people at ease and we all look our best when we smile. Practice your handshake. Aim for firm but not a vice-like grip. Try to be the first to extend, indicates confidence and an interest in others.</p>
<p><em><strong>Presentation</strong></em> Make the effort to present yourself well as first impressions leave an impression. Dress so you are comfortable, yet look smart. Showing you care about your presentation communicates that you care about your business and clients. Have plenty of your business cards on hand and a pen.</p>
<p><em><strong>Be prepared</strong></em> Be very clear about who your potential client is, what they need and what problem you solve for them. Be able to describe your offer simply yet confidently. Be proud of what you offer, passion is compelling and magnetic. Be willing to share what you know, who you know and who you are in order to offer as much value as possible. Focus on what you can give rather than what you are hoping to gain. If networking makes you super anxious, write down a list of interesting questions to ask people you have just met that you might like to be asked. People particularly love to talk about themselves, so open questions work well and genuinely listen to people. A good listener is always valued. Think about anyone you know that the person you are talking to could benefit from meeting. People love people who love to help people.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p><em><strong>Take it easy</strong></em> You will never meet everyone at large networking events. Trust that you will meet who you need to whether it be for your benefit or because you can add value to their business. Keep an eye out for the mover and shaker in the room, take advantage of their knowledge. Expert networkers are connectors and love connecting others. Even if you don’t know them, introduce yourself and talk a little about what brought you to the event and ask they know whom might be good for you to talk to.</p>
<p><em><strong>Follow up system</strong></em> Develop a system for keeping in touch or following up with people you connect with. Find simple ways to re-connect, whether it’s to follow through on a promise of an introduction, or an article on a topic you discussed. Make it natural, authentic and not too frequent. You are aiming to build a normal relationship that happens to provide an opportunity for both of you to benefit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Schedule networking</strong></em> Building a strong professional network takes time. Like a marathon it takes regular training efforts. The best approach is to schedule time each week to research events that suit your business goals, whether it’s for other likeminded business owners or to find customers. If It’s not scheduled it isn’t likely to happen in the regular fashion that makes a difference.</p>
<p>Networking is about building real relationships, actively maintaining them, and giving as much as you receive, without expecting anything in return.</p>

			<p>“If you build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful”.</p>
<p>By Amazon founder &amp; CEO, Jeff Bezos</p>
<p>How do you exceed a customer’s expectation so they become a strong advocate for your business? Every business owner wants to create a memorable service experience, so how do you create that special feeling that compels a customer to promote you? This article will provide from my experience #1 secret to small business success so your customers love you. Most of my life has been involved in honing this skill and over the next two weeks I will share my 5 tips to keep your customers loving, trusting, returning, buying, and raving about you. Today, let me share my #1 key to small business success I learnt during my former life as a Client Relationship Manager, managing multi-million dollar corporate accounts. In this role, I liaised between my employer and my customer, aiming to keep the two customers happy at the same time often with different priorities. For over 10 years in this role I honed this skill through trial and error. It is very simple and is all about communication. Manage your customer’s expectations at every customer touch point. At every step of delivering your product and service to customers, ensure they know the bare minimum of what is happening or going to happen. It is difficult to delight and surprise customers when the basics aren’t dealt with. We can consider managing customers expectations much like comparing a bad boyfriend to a great one. One doesn’t call when he say’s he will, cancels dates without warning, doesn’t remember the little things. The other one follows through on his promises, surprises you with flowers at a dinner date. No brainer really who is a keeper!</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieving this ‘perfect date’:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>1. Make a list considering each touch-point that your business has with your customer.</ol>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>2. Create a list of unexpected service extras for your customers that can be utilized at different parts of the service cycle.</ol>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>3. Create communications to outline the relevant what, how, when &amp; cost of each of these touch-points.</ol>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>4. If miscommunications or difficulties arise, always, always pick up the phone. It’s an easy option is to send an email however you miss an opportunity to build a relationship. Email is a very limited method of communication when you need to listen and resolve. A problem can be generally be resolved in one conversation, it takes way longer over email.</ol>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>5. Engage your customers to ensure what you are promising is matching their expectations. Rectify if required. Gain approval, then follow through.</ol>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>6. Once the service is completed, summarize the what, how, when of the service you delivered, as promised.</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every business will have different ways of implementing these steps. Create clear and simple communications, signs, brochures, flyers, documents, timelines or emails that outline the processes and stages the customer will experience. If you are regularly communicating stages and processes to customers it allows them a chance to raise any concerns or confusions along the way, before it becomes a huge problem or snowballs.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">To keep it simple, think of how you plan out a speech: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Tell them what you are going to tell them</li>
<li>Tell them what you said you were going to tell them</li>
<li>Tell them what you told them</li>
</ul>
<p>My #1 secret to small business success is simple and ensures you have customers that are confident and trust you. Over my years in customer relations this tip has been the key in retaining clients, keeping them happy and having them refer me to other clients.</p>
