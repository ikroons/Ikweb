The great news is that the eligibility includes upgrading an existing product with additional features that provide greater digital capability. If you have used one of the products such as Shopify in the past, which is more than a year ago, and resume the adoption of the digital product you will also be eligible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What doesn\u2019t the program cover?<\/h2>\n<p>The program does not cover renewals of existing digital products provided as part of the program. It also does not include minor updates to existing products. Most importantly, the digital product, such as Shopify, must be available under the program.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How will I know how to use the digital products available under the <em>Small Business Digital Adaption Program <\/em>?<\/h2>\n<p>Once you are registered under the program, free training and workshops are available and training dates are available in the training calendar that is published on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business.vic.gov.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Business Victoria<\/a> website.
