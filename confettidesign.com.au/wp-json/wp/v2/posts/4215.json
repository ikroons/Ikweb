She has her finger on the pulse that woman and has insights&nbsp;that always surprise me.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been 3 years since we set our \u2018why\u2019 and&nbsp;purpose and wrote the mission for Confetti Design so it was a timely question. And having not thought of our mission statement or conscious business purpose as a \u2018manifesto\u2019 I took the invitation to delve into this new world. How did I want to step forward into this world with 3 years of business under my belt. What did we want to stand for now? What do we want be know for?&nbsp;How do we want to be remembered in the work we produce or the experiences we provide for our clients.<\/p>\n<p>After getting my \u2018google-on\u2019 and reading a few dozen articles on Google to get my head around:&nbsp;What is a manifesto? I now have a fair idea what this \u2018manifesto\u2019 biz is about. This article will look at what is a manifesto; how it can be a powerful tool for your business and personal life and some tips on how to write one.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What is a manifesto?<\/h2>\n<p>Traditionally, a manifesto is a written statement where you publicly declare your\u2026&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intentions (what you intend to do)<\/li>\n<li>Beliefs (what your opinions are; your view of a particular topic)<\/li>\n<li>Vision (the type of business \/ life or world that you dream about and wish to create)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>From my findings, manifestos of all varieties are cool and there are no real rules except your main goal is for someone to get a better feeling of you or greater understanding of you, your business or project after reading it. Of course a personal manifesto can be very very private and personal and shared with no-one, choice is yours.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of a business manifesto, a good one makes us think \u2018this is a business with meaning; these people get it.\u2019 The best business manifestos really need to be written with your customers in mind. They consider what the primary purpose of your business is and tell people what change you wish to bring.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.\u201d&nbsp;~ Simon Sinek<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>When we work with our clients on their branding and websites they undergo a thorough briefing process where we encourage them to watch the Ted talk of Simon\u2019s called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action\" target=\"_blank\">Start With Why<\/a>. This actually allows our clients to identify their purpose for business. It allows us to get into their hearts and minds and gives us the magic insights to design a brand and online presence that truly represents their higher purpose.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of a manifesto?<\/h2>\n<p>The great by-product of a manifesto is that like values, once set you have a framework in which to make decisions more easily, evaluation opportunities and stick to your priorities when conflicts arise.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore we can see a manifesto is a great way to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clarify your beliefs<\/li>\n<li>Name your guiding purpose for being in business<\/li>\n<li>Examine your&nbsp;motivations<\/li>\n<li>Create \u201cpolicies\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Describe what kind of business you\u2019d like to own or work in<\/li>\n<li>The type of values your customers would have<\/li>\n<li>Write down your goals<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Your manifesto doesn\u2019t have to be extreme or only written once. It doesn\u2019t need to be long. It can be bullet points; or you could write it like a letter. You could even review each year to see how your goals have changed or values evolved.<\/p>\n<p>A manifesto could encompass goals for the whole life of your business, or a goal for one product or service, a goal for a shorter period or for a project. See a few below for inspiration including how Apple use their manifesto as a guiding light for business culture and product development. And Seth Goden\u2019s could be adopted by any sales or marketing business.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here is Apple\u2019s Manifesto written by Tim Cook<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em> We believe that we\u2019re on the face of the earth to make great products.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em> We\u2019re constantly focusing on innovating.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em> We believe in the simple, not the complex.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em> We believe we need to own and control the primary&nbsp;technologies&nbsp;behind the products that we make and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em> We believe in saying no to thousands of projects so that we can focus on the few that are meaningful to us.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>6.We believe in deep collaboration&nbsp;and cross pollination in order to innovate in a way others cannot.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>We don\u2019t settle for anything other than excellence in any group in the company.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>We have the self-honesty to admit when we\u2019re wrong and the courage to change.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Seth Goden\u2019s \u2013 my favourite marketing guru<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><em> The greatest innovations appear to come from those that are self-reliant.

This ensures it&#8217;s super easy to say yes or no to a project. These questions also allow you to highlight your strengths as an integral part of your manifesto and goals.<\/p>\n<p>If these questions haven&#8217;t resonated or you have trouble identifying your \u2018why\u2019 through the Simon Sinek approach, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.valuablecontent.co.uk\/blog\/how-to-write-a-business-manifesto\" target=\"_blank\">Valuable Content<\/a> have a couple of great exercises to use, summarized below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Start with a rant to see what really riles you and gets up passionate<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>When it comes to your industry what really winds you up?<\/li>\n<li>What do you rile against?<\/li>\n<li>What does everyone else get wrong?<\/li>\n<li>What could be so much better if people only DID SOMETHING about it?<\/li>\n<li>If you were King or Queen of your industry what would STOP happening RIGHT NOW!!!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Then flip it<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Then turn the negatives into positives. When you do this ensure it keeps the perspective on the customer not you.<\/p>\n<p>As an example your rant maybe:<br \/>\n\u201cI hate the way small businesses are treated like second class citizens in the business world. There\u2019s just not enough of the right support out there, and their contribution to the UK economy is seriously underplayed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Flip it to:<br \/>\n\u201cSmall business is the lifeblood of the UK economy, and it deserves the very best support.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Make sure your statement doesn\u2019t become:<br \/>\n\u201cI service small business better than anyone\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do some customer research to get your tone of voice right for your manifesto.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What matters to your customers?<\/li>\n<li>How does your approach make things better for them?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can then find the intersection of your principles or values and those of your clients. Making these a manifesto feature or a \u2018sticky\u2019 service goal.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After all my reading and exploring of the range of manifesto&#8217;s I am going to lock myself away for a few hours and refine our purpose led mission statement into a manifesto. I am liking this approach to help guide us in the next phase of our business existence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Best of luck with your manifesto or purpose driven mission statement for your business.<\/p>\n<p>For further inspiration try here There are over 1000 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.1000manifestos.com\/list\/\" target=\"_blank\">HERE<\/a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I recently had a session with my Intuitive Business Coach, Monique Evans of Intuitive Freedom&nbsp;where [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":10318,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[188,185,179],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v15.7 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What Is A Manifesto?
