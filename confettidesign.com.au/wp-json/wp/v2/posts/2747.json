One speaker we heard from Tarnya Cook, Editor of <a href=\"http:\/\/contentmagazine.com.au\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Australian Content Magazine<\/a>, shared her 3 tips on raising your profile. A goal of mine this year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tarnya\u2019s 3 tips were:<\/strong><br \/>\n1. Find your passion and take action<br \/>\n2. Use your social media platforms, chose two and set goals to achieve (she recommends Instagram)<br \/>\n3. Seek out opportunities to be seen both online and offline (article contributions, speaking, networking)<\/p>\n<p>What I enjoyed about this list was we focus on what works for us. Each of our paths is different and we each bring unique skills to our paths, so our choices will need to be different too. There will always be some similarities and things that worked for me, work for you, but on the whole I have to carve out what I will try.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore thinking about #1 how do we do that exactly. Well I have observed people and when they talk about certain parts of their business they get really excited, passionate, enthusiastic and thier voice changes. I would ask others what they think it is for you if you have trouble identifying it.<\/p>\n<p>Number #2<br \/>\nI agree about the goal aspect. What is a business goal? Increase your list, increase your sales by x by x?<br \/>\nThen consider where is your customer mostly hanging out? Which social media platform do you enjoy the most. I am a firm believer in what you give out comes back in multiple. It\u2019s energy out, energy in. Applying that principle, if you love a social media platform and you tweak your value based activity to suit your goal and customer, you may find that you reach you goals better than if you plugged away at something that is arduous and heavy in energy.<\/p>\n<p>Number #3<br \/>\nI was at a training event recently where a lady was bemoaning the fact she is always being asked to write for National Newspapers and magazines, yet they don\u2019t want to pay her. Everyone else in the room\u2019s mouth dropped. We were all thinking the same thing, \u201cyou get asked to do that and you are unhappy they don\u2019t want to pay you?\u201d FREE PUBLICITY my dear!<br \/>\nWe aren\u2019t all as lucky as this woman, yet we can put ourselves out there to ask if anyone would like contributors.<br \/>\nThis has been a key point in my marketing plan to date and I am happy with the results of taking this approach. Networking at events where my customers are, offering to provide content when publications either request or not, both off and online.<br \/>\nOffering to participate in workshops as a free speaker.<\/p>\n<p>Tarnya\u2019s 3 tips to raise your profile are great and most effective when we start with the end in mind. If you are like me and work around school drop off and pick up, we have to be very careful of our time and not spend countless hours in activity that leads know where. Start with a goal then look at these three things and choose your activity. Love to hear how you get on.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>She hosted a recent lunch with some local business women and 2 speakers.
