This article will help to explain what is the difference between a logo and a brand.<\/p>\n<p>We can all agree having a logo is a key element to effectively marketing your business \u2013 just look at Virgin or fashion houses like Chanel, but what many people don\u2019t consider is the messages or emotions you want to evoke in a prospective customer before you start the designing process. The brand is what people feel about your business, the impression they are left with, the reputation is built into the brand personality not simply the logo.<br \/>\nThe reason you want to make this distinction is that you will be able to achieve results that make a difference to your bottom line by determining the message behind your brand. You&#8217;ve heard the phrase, &#8220;A picture says a thousand words.&#8221; This is so true of your branding. The first thing some of your customers will come in contact with regarding your company is your brand. This first impression will last forever.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Your Brand is What People Say about You When you\u2019re Not Around.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>When developing a new brand or reviewing how effective your existing brand is, there are some questions to ask yourself: <\/strong><br \/>\n\u2022 What do we want to be known for?<\/p>\n<ul>o Is it sophistication, quickness, strength, proven results, expert knowledge, easy of service, creativity<\/ul>\n<p>\u2022 What core values underpin who we are as a company \/ business?<\/p>\n<ul>o Integrity, honesty, care, approachable, fun<\/ul>\n<p>\u2022 What emotions do we want to evoke in our prospective customer?<br \/>\no Trust, relief, satisfaction, commitment, excitement,<\/p>\n<ul>\u2022 Who do we want to attract as a customer? (be specific and niche)<\/ul>\n<p>o All single mothers of toddlers living anywhere in Australia who also work part-time and are committed to being strong and healthy but don\u2019t have time to go to gym<\/p>\n<ul>\u2022 Does our target market identify with your current brand? (Ask them in a survey)<\/ul>\n<p><strong>How do these impact the design of a brand?<\/strong><br \/>\nA businesses brand elements; colours, typography, visuals, logo, work together to identify and distinguish the brand in the consumers&#8217; mind. Your brand personality leaves an impression that either engages the consumer or doesn\u2019t. What you aim for is a brand identity that communicates your unique voice and that voice speaks directly to YOUR customer. In order to know how to do this you must research and think about exactly HOW you want to be perceived and WHO you want to serve in your business then make sure these actually match, their worlds collide so-to-speak!<\/p>\n<p>Thinking about your customer as well as what is unique about your service will help your designer determine the following; <\/p>\n<ul>o the type images to use in the website, insta feed or marketing collateral<\/ul>\n<ul>o the colours and colour intensity used in your brand<\/ul>\n<ul>o the font selection<\/ul>\n<ul>o the scale of the logo<\/ul>\n<ul>o elements used in creating a logo such as lines, repetition, organic shapes versus geometric<\/ul>\n<p>All these elements will help to create the perfect brand persona for your business that also attracts that perfect customer.
