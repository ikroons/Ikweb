Effective networking is all about developing valuable relationships over time. It\u2019s about growing a pool of people who know about and value what you do.<\/p>\n<p>The benefit of a good network is it gives you resources, inspiration, information, and connection to potential clients and referrals. As a small business owner it\u2019s an important element of my marketing mix to regularly scheduling networking activities that increase my exposure and contacts.<\/p>\n<p>This week\u2019s blog article provides 7 ways to make networking easier, especially if social occasions make you anxious like me. These tips will help prepare you so you can\u00a0network like a pro even if you are an introvert or inexperienced.<\/p>\n<p>Practical tips<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Practice on people you are comfortable with<\/strong><\/em> If the idea of approaching people you don&#8217;t know intimidates you, begin your networking efforts by seeking out familiar faces, such as relatives and friends, at school and sporting occasions. A series of successful conversations will make you more confident in the process.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Body Language<\/strong><\/em> It\u2019s important to make eye contact and remember people\u2019s names, so practice until you perfect this. Not only is this good manners, it is an easy way to show people they matter and you have been paying attention. Smile a warm authentic smile: it puts people at ease and we all look our best when we smile. Practice your handshake. Aim for firm but not a vice-like grip. Try to be the first to extend, indicates confidence and an interest in others.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Presentation<\/strong><\/em> Make the effort to present yourself well as first impressions leave an impression. Dress so you are comfortable, yet look smart. Showing you care about your presentation communicates that you care about your business and clients. Have plenty of your business cards on hand and a pen.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Be prepared<\/strong><\/em> Be very clear about who your potential client is, what they need and what problem you solve for them. Be able to describe your offer simply yet confidently. Be proud of what you offer, passion is compelling and magnetic. Be willing to share what you know, who you know and who you are in order to offer as much value as possible. Focus on what you can give rather than what you are hoping to gain. If networking makes you super anxious, write down a list of interesting questions to ask people you have just met that you might like to be asked. People particularly love to talk about themselves, so open questions work well and genuinely listen to people. A good listener is always valued. Think about anyone you know that the person you are talking to could benefit from meeting. People love people who love to help people.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text disable_pattern=&#8221;false&#8221; align=&#8221;left&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1521196522987{margin-bottom: 0px !important;}&#8221;]<em><strong>Take it easy<\/strong><\/em> You will never meet everyone at large networking events. Trust that you will meet who you need to whether it be for your benefit or because you can add value to their business. Keep an eye out for the mover and shaker in the room, take advantage of their knowledge. Expert networkers are connectors and love connecting others. Even if you don\u2019t know them, introduce yourself and talk a little about what brought you to the event and ask they know whom might be good for you to talk to.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Follow up system<\/strong><\/em> Develop a system for keeping in touch or following up with people you connect with. Find simple ways to re-connect, whether it\u2019s to follow through on a promise of an introduction, or an article on a topic you discussed. Make it natural, authentic and not too frequent. You are aiming to build a normal relationship that happens to provide an opportunity for both of you to benefit.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Schedule networking<\/strong><\/em> Building a strong professional network takes time. Like a marathon it takes regular training efforts. The best approach is to schedule time each week to research events that suit your business goals, whether it\u2019s for other likeminded business owners or to find customers. If It\u2019s not scheduled it isn\u2019t likely to happen in the regular fashion that makes a difference.<\/p>\n<p>Networking is about building real relationships, actively maintaining them, and giving as much as you receive, without expecting anything in return.<\/p>\n<p>You might also like to read about <a href=\"https:\/\/confettidesign.com.au\/networking-made-easy\/\">how to make networking easier <\/a>on this page <a href=\"https:\/\/confettidesign.com.au\/networking-made-easy\/\">here.<\/a> Good luck out there, we may cross paths one day soon![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learning how to network for business effectively is a very powerful tool for growth.
