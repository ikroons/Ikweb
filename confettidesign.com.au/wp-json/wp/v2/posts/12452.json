Increase Traffic on your Website<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As a business owner, your goal is to pique the interest of your target market, so that they will visit your site and increase your chances of making a sale. Posting your blog links in social media increases your chances to accomplish that goal.<\/p>\n<p>Create a blog which is catchy, informative, and up to date. Posting these blog links in your store\u2019s social media accounts will serve as an ad for your website. Depending on how useful your blogs are to the readers, the blog link will generate clicks and drive visitors \/ \u00a0traffic to your website, which is a big step towards increasing your sales!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Brand Identity<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are numerous steps into starting up your brand identity. You\u2019ll have to think about your niche, your market, a catchy <a href=\"https:\/\/confettidesign.com.au\/how-to-name-small-business\/\">brand name<\/a>, and most especially\u2014building your brand identity.<\/p>\n<p>When you think about a product, a specific brand usually comes to mind. For example, when thinking about carbonated drinks or soft drinks, you\u2019ll probably think about Coca Cola. Or when thinking about toothpaste, you\u2019ll immediately think about Colgate. These brands established their identity throughout the years by executing effective marketing strategies, which helped them gain the trust and loyalty of their customers. Same can be done with e-commerce websites. A blog is another tool to use in establishing your identity in a world full of rival brands and similar products.<\/p>\n<p>Blogging provides a voice to your business. \u00a0You can use it to build your business\u2019s unique personality which separates you from your competitors. Things to consider are what do you want to be known for that are also important to your customer? How can you give personality and life to your brand through your writing? \u00a0Your initial blogs could include answers to the basic identity questions: 1- who are you, and 2- what value your product or service gives to your customers. These will be ingrained in your readers\u2019 minds as you write more and more articles on your website. In time, your readers may become your customers and eventually, your brand ambassadors!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Build an Online Community<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you keep posting helpful and relative blogs consistently, your community of readers which are originally your searchers will keep going back to your site for new information. The comments that your viewers leave in your blog will spark a meaningful conversation with like minded people about the topics.<\/p>\n<p>Blogs that are personalized and relatable are the ones readers usually react to. Make your blogging as inclusive and interactive as possible, specially when you are trying to build a community of brand supporters. Write about how your product contributes or solves a problem in their life. Encourage comments and conversations within your blog as these will also help in making your blog rank higher in related topics.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Enhance Your Writing Skills<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As important as having including a blog in your e-commerce website is, making sure your content is relevant and easy to read it also vital. Writing them doesn\u2019t just keep you well connected to your business and your brand, but also helps develop your communication skills.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some factors to consider when you are starting to write a blog for your online store:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your relevance. <\/strong>If not talking about products or services you offer, your blog\u00a0should always have a connection to what your online store is offering.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your audience.\u00a0<\/strong>Some blog writers are so used to using technical terms that they forget to consider who the target audience is. Basic rule is to make sure your writing style is conversational and simple. A common standard is aim for it to be understood by a high schooler! Writing like the way you talk is often a great start. Ultimately the goal is to engage your target audience so they stay on your site for longer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your structure.\u00a0<\/strong>Keep a structure which allows your audience to fully digest your blog content. The basic structure of a blog is 1-having an introduction of the topic, 2- giving more details about the topic and sub topics, and finally, summarising the main message of your blog. Structure using a hierarchy of information is also important for ranking. Google is more likely to rank your articles if they are structures logically.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your consistency<\/strong>. Decide on whether you will write a blog on a weekly or a monthly basis. This will not only help you rank higher in search engines\u2014it will also keep your customers informed of the current trends and news about your business. This will gain more engagement to your current and future customers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The e-commerce world is growing rapidly, hence the continued importance of having a blog for your website.
