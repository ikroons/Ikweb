In the US 71% of businesses are on Instagram, there is no denying it is the place to be, and the visual nature of Instagram makes it likely to be the leader for a while to come.<br \/>\nIf you are not on Instagram then read up on our easy to follow steps so you start the right way. If you are already a gun on \u2018the gram\u2019 then these tips will be a good checklist to make sure you stay at the top of your game!<br \/>\nThis guide will take you through the 4 steps to starting in Instagram the right way that will make both the returns for your efforts and the on-going management so much easier.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Step 1 \u2013 Understanding your customer<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Before you even think of creating the account, you want to get crystal clear on who your jewelry customer is. Truly understanding your target market is one of the most crucial things in running a successful business. It is only by having a clear idea in your mind of who you would like to reach, sell to or help that you can tailor and target your messages to have the strongest impact on your audience.<\/p>\n<p>This has to be the key step that underpins your future success on Instagram. And really any marketing activity. Without it all your posting is like a scatter gun approach and the likelihood of connecting with your audience is slim.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why do you need to know your customer so clearly?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1. You can create content to engage and connect with them when you have them in the forefront of your mind.<br \/>\n2. You can ask yourself \u2018will our perfect customer relate to this, be inspired to act, feel an emotional connection, be moved, feel like we \u2018get them?\u2019<br \/>\n3. If you wish to use influencers, knowing who your customer is ensures you pick the right influencer.<br \/>\n4. Engaging in cross promotions is easier as you look for other businesses who share the same customer.<br \/>\n5. Although not a direct impact on your Instagram activity, knowing WHERE your customer hangs out or what they do in their life can guide your traditional marketing efforts. Local cafes to be linked with, event venues, magazines to advertise in. When you know where your customer spends their life means you can position yourself literally in their sight!<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Basics<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 What are your customer\u2019s values? What is important to them?<br \/>\n\u2022 What is their lifestyle? Or how do they spend their time? What is important to them?<br \/>\n\u2022 What is their age?<br \/>\n\u2022 Where do they live?<br \/>\n\u2022 Is there a specific gender you serve more than another? \u2013 Who is really doing the research on your product?<br \/>\n\u2022 What brands do they love?<br \/>\n\u2022 Where do they eat, holiday, shop regularly?<br \/>\n\u2022 What are their aspirations?<br \/>\n\u2022 What magazines do they read, films watch, Netflix shows?<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Problems<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 List all the problems you solve for your customers?<br \/>\n\u2022 What emotions do they feel at the exact moment they discover your store and service?<br \/>\n\u2022 What specific words and phrases are they saying to themselves or using to friends when describing how it feels to discover your service?<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Solutions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter whether you could realistically deliver or create these experiences, the goal is simply to unlock your imagination and challenge yourself to step into your customer\u2019s shoes and see things in a new way. These insights will help with the type of content you create and how you try to engage your customers via Instagram.<br \/>\nBefore they found you what was their reality as it relates to buying a product like yours?<br \/>\n\u2022 How were they trying to solve the problem?<br \/>\n\u2022 Where were they looking to find a solution?<br \/>\n\u2022 Who were they talking to in order to find a solution?<br \/>\n\u2022 How was it impacting their personal life?<br \/>\n\u2022 Have they tried other solutions before?<br \/>\n\u2022 Why did that solution not work for them? Why are they still looking?<br \/>\n\u2022 What do they wish Jewelers understood about them?<br \/>\n\u2022 What is your customer\u2019s dream? In their ideal world, what\u2019s their ultimate fantasy of how your product or service would be delivered?<br \/>\n\u2022 Do they have barriers to purchase from you?<\/p>\n<p>The answers to these questions help build out a real picture of your target audience\/s. Now you have this \u2018persona\u2019 or \u2018ideal customer\u2019 described it\u2019s useful to even go to the extent of naming them, find images from magazines to visualize the perfect customers. It may be that you base this avatar on one of your best customers. In fact you could go to your most loyal customer and ask them to help answer the questions.<\/p>\n<p>You not only have an amazing understanding of who you need to connect with via your posts, you also have a huge amount of content right in those answers.
