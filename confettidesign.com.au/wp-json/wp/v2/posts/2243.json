And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and will be lost.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Determine your unique offerings to differentiate yourself from your competitors by using your stories, your strengths, skills, personality, passions, quirks.<\/p>\n<p>Be in love with what you are offering because it shows when you are not. When you create services or products that you know are needed but they aren\u2019t your unique gift in action, people can tell. Change your offerings so you love what you do and how you deliver it. It creates a positive energy, your services will be easier to sell and you will attract more customers as it\u2019s effortlessness creativity in action. Change your offerings if need be. Remove the struggle by allowing your intuition a chance to fly, you may have to go against the grain in order to so do, and feel uncomfortable, but it will be worth it.<\/p>\n<p>As Seth Godin says:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cOur job is to make change. Our job is to connect to people, to interact with them in a way that leaves them better than we found them, more able to get where they\u2019d like to go. Every time we waste that opportunity, every page or sentence that doesn\u2019t do enough to advance the cause is waste.\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>People will be buying or using you for several reasons and most of them will likely not be because of the product, it will be because of an experience or a story of themselves that they are wishing to tell the world about themselves. They fulfill a deep want, desire, belief and worldview.<\/p>\n<p>Such as why buy a BMW when a Ford does the job? Why buy a Tiffany necklace when a Myer branded one looking the same will do? People buy a result, a solution, or an outcome that is tied to a desire to be significant, happy, powerful, prestigious, loved or important .<br \/>\nTo figure this out for your service or product consider what are the premium brand emotions you can use for your brand that create an experience your customer will love and wish to have?<\/p>\n<p>To attract customers and have your existing ones become incredible advocates, make the process of working with you easy and a joy, even if they are coming to you for teeth removal! Making the offering easy to acquire, the service experience simple or fun, remove any barriers or challenges. Making a customers life easier, makes it a no brainer. You may consider making the offering a premium offering if your preference is to add lots of value as a service differentiator. Think about their pain points, what pain can you eliminate. What can you do that others in the market don\u2019t consider doing? Be original or quirky.<\/p>\n<p>A great resource is &#8220;Blue Ocean Strategy&#8221;, a book written by\u00a0W.
