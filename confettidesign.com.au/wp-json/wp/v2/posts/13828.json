Many consumers are looking to increase their skill set and knowledge by completing online training programs, rather than physically attending schools. An LMS delivers content, which can include knowledge documents, videos, courses and quizzes. The team at Confetti Design has delivered several projects using the learning management system <em>Access Ally<\/em>, and we thought it was worthwhile to review and detail this LMS.<\/h6>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What is <em>Access Alley<\/em>?<\/h2>\n<p>Many LMS are not a stand-alone system and are plugins for websites such as WordPress. <em>Access Ally<\/em> is a complete plugin for WordPress that enables small business to build an \u00a0online learning business within their WordPress small business website. <em>Access Ally <\/em>focuses on deep CRM integration, and simplifies the process to add tests, progress the tracking of course completion, video links or anything else you would like to offer on your course pages. <em>Access Ally<\/em> \u00a0supports the upload of student work. The key selling point for <em>Access Ally<\/em> is its integration with your existing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) program.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How did <em>Access Ally<\/em> start?<\/h2>\n<p><em>Access Ally <\/em>began as way to manage access to online courses and quickly developed into a full service membership plugin. <em>Access Ally <\/em>has WordPress-themed order forms that allows users to offer one-time payments, subscriptions. It is enhanced with individually triggered time-sensitive coupons, including trial offers, and 1-click upsells to your customers. <em>Access Ally <\/em>enables members to manage their credit cards that are on file and their subscriptions from within Access Ally.<\/p>\n<h2><em>Access Ally<\/em> Pricing \u2013 A Simple Offer<\/h2>\n<p><em>Access Ally <\/em>\u00a0has a transparent pricing offer ,where subscribers pay one flat fee, regardless of the number of courses, memberships, or members a small business will have. Even better, <em>Access Ally <\/em>does not take commissions on any of your online course sales, and integrates with Stripe and PayPal straight out of the box.<\/p>\n<h2>Why <em>Access Ally <\/em>over other Learning Management Systems<\/h2>\n<p><em>Access Ally <\/em>prides its on being the one tool that simply handles everything<em> &#8211;<\/em> from accepting payments, the ability to create courses, easy integrations with online tools such as:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Active Campaign<\/li>\n<li>Convert Kit<\/li>\n<li>Drip<\/li>\n<li>Infusionsoft<\/li>\n<li>Keap<\/li>\n<li>Ontraport, and of course CRM\u2019s.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It offers the best member management of any LMS on the market. There is effortless integration of <em>Access Ally\u2019s<\/em> learning management system (LMS) with your existing CRM. Small business will not need to pay for and integrate additional plugins to handle payments and payment administration, membership levels to run cohesive membership sites, and integration with your CRM for marketing automation. Some of the course features include:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instant and dripped courses<\/li>\n<li>Team accounts<\/li>\n<li>Progress tracking of courses<\/li>\n<li>Homework submissions<\/li>\n<li>Video view tracking and bookmarks<\/li>\n<li>Quizzes and Certificates<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>The <em>Access Ally<\/em> Functionality \u2013 the Course Creation Wizard<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The team at Confetti Design found the ease of use and functionality of <em>Access Ally&#8217;s Course Creation Wizard<\/em> a great selling point for this LMS as it creates courses as a WordPress page. Small business can easily keep their content, or import it into another LMS product later. When evaluating LMS\u2019s for our small business website customers, we found many business lose access to their content if they decide to cancel their LMS subscription, which is not the case with <em>Access Ally<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Access Ally <\/em>enables small business to select your LMS compatible \u201cWordPress theme\u201d for functionality, speed, design flexibility, and features. There is no requirement for someone who can code in CSS to make the design, such as buttons and breadcrumbs, look and feel modern. It\u2019s all in <em>Access Ally<\/em>!<\/p>\n<p><strong><em><br \/>\nAccess Ally<\/em><\/strong><strong> and Woman of Confidence<br \/>\n<\/strong><em><br \/>\n<\/em>Suzie Lightfoot is a personal branding coach, mentor, keynote speaker and online course creator\u00a0for women. \u00a0Suzie has been working as a coach for years in this space but this year wanted to reach\u00a0 more women and so created a powerful online course that wraps up everything she\u2019s learned from years of experience in media, PR, Marketing and building her own highly successful brand and business into an easy to follow step-by-step online course.<\/p>\n<h1><\/h1>\n<p>We updated her business site, iformat our SEO partner optimised the sitemap and pages and we integrated Access Ally into the course site to house the free membership and paid courses.
